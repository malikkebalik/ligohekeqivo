His father is an investor and well-known patron of the arts, and his mother is a native of Cebu, Phillippines with Chinese, Filipino, and Spanish heritage. His father is a native of Pittsburgh and has European descent.

He then relocated back to San Francisco, where he attended various Roman Catholic schools. After graduating, he attended the University of Michigan. He then graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 2009, having majored in theatre performance and minored in Musicology and Italian.</p><p>From a very early age, Criss displayed a strong interest in the arts. He started playing violin lessons at age five, and these lessons continued for the next 15 years. During this period, he also learned how to play the piano, the guitar, the mandolin, the harmonica, and the drums. During his high school years, he became the concertmaster of his school orchestra and created his own band. At the age of 15, he began studying music composition and wrote his own songs.</p><p>He proved to be equally proficient in the performing arts. By the age of 10, he had been accepted into the American Conservatory Theater. During his high school years, he performed in many school plays. While attending the University of Michigan, he became heavily involved in a student-run theatre organization as both an actor and a director. He also spent one summer studying Italian theatre in Arezzo, Italy during his college years.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Darren began his acting career on stage.

During his teen years, he followed up with roles in plays like "A Midsummer Night's Dream." During his college years, Criss appeared in plays like "A Few Good Men" and "Pride and Prejudice."</p><p>After graduating from university, Darren and his friends founded StarKid Productions, a musical theatre company.
