She was born as the second child and lone daughter of Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; her mother would go on to become Queen Elizabeth II a few years later. Anne's older brother is <a href=#>King Charles</a>. Growing up, Anne was looked after and educated by her governess Catherine Peebles. She later attended Benenden School in Kent, finishing in 1968 with two A-Levels and six GCE O-Levels.</p><h2 id=equestrian-career><strong>Equestrian Career</strong></h2><p>In the 70s, Anne became a celebrated equestrian. Early in the decade, she finished fourth at the Rushall Horse Trials and won gold in the individual event at the European Eventing Championship in Burghley.

Following her riding career, Anne served as the president of the FÃ©dÃ©ration Equestre Internationale from 1986 to 1994.</p><h2 id=royal-activities><strong>Royal Activities</strong></h2><p>As a royal, Anne has undertaken various duties on behalf of her mother. She had her first public engagement in 1969, when she appeared at the opening of an educational and training center in Shropshire, England. Anne soon began traveling abroad, visiting such countries as Norway, Germany, Austria, Jamaica, New Zealand, and Australia. In 1990, she became the first member of the British royal family to make an official visit to the USSR.
