"Levels", fueled by a sample from <a href=# title="Etta James Net Worth">Etta James</a>' classic, "Something's Got a Hold on Me", was a major hit all over Europe, reaching #1 in three countries, and sitting comfortably within the Top 10 in 12 others.&nbsp; He bounced from #33 to #6 on the DJ Top 100 list.&nbsp; In 2012, he received a Grammy nomination for his track, "Sunshine", with legendary DJ, <a href=# title="David Guetta Net Worth">David Guetta</a>.&nbsp; He was featured at Lollapalooza and became the first DJ to headline a concert at Radio City Music Hall.&nbsp; In 2013, he received his second Grammy nomination, won his first MTV European Music Award, and the American Music Award for Favorite Electronic Dance Music Artist.&nbsp; He started 2014 with the announcement of his collaboration with <a href=#>Madonna</a>, and the announcement that a popular French radio station launched a web station devoted entirely to his music.&nbsp; He's doing all right.</p><p></p><p>All of that success necessitated a step up in the home owning department, of course. So he took the step.&nbsp; Avicii purchased a <strong>$15.5 million</strong> home in the Hollywood Hills.&nbsp; The massive structure on Blue Jay Way has six bedrooms and seven bathrooms.&nbsp; The home is notable for its funky architecture, which features walls that open directly to the outside world in all rooms, stunning views of the surrounding area, and a man-made stream that runs through the entire house and empties into a multi-level infinity pool outside.&nbsp; The design, by McLean Design, is meant to eliminate any sense of separation between outside and inside.&nbsp; The amount of glass used to construct the 7,007 square-foot building does just that.&nbsp; It's not a home for people who want privacy exactly.&nbsp; It's more like a super-modern square fishbowl.&nbsp; However, the property is fitted with a security system that uses fingerprint recognition to open doors, so even if just about anyone can see in, getting inside the gates will be much more difficult.&nbsp; Though his face might not be totally recognizable now, his collaboration with Madonna is probably going to do away with any privacy he may still be able to enjoy.&nbsp; Want to take a bet on how long it takes before people are camped outside, craning for a glimpse of him, every day?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeRq7aktchmqqeZl6h6coGMbmSmoZyhtrC6jKaYp6uZpLtutM6lo7Kvn6SxbrnAo6arZZOkua2twaipmqyZpLtuucCdpqemkWQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./deborah-sheridan-taylor-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Deborah Sheridan-Taylor Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./xaviera-hollander-biograf%C3%ADa-edad-altura-esposa-net-worth-familia.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Xaviera Hollander biografa, edad, altura, esposa, net worth, familia</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
