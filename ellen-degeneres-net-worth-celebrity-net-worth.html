The show was groundbreaking, especially when, in 1997, her character came out as gay in a two-part episode titled "The Puppy Episode." Simultaneously, Ellen publicly came out on "The <a href=# title="Oprah Winfrey Net Worth">Oprah Winfrey</a> Show," making her one of the first major Hollywood stars to do so.</p><p>After "Ellen" ended, she ventured into daytime television with "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" in 2003.
