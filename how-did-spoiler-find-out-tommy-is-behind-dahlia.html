That’s thanks to <a href=#>his new Dahlia product</a>, a feel-good drug with the potential to become one of the most addictive in the city. Tommy’s power play was to keep his involvement a secret. But in the latest episode, which aired on <a href=#>Starz</a> on April 10, it came out.</p><p id=par-2_14><strong>[Warning: This article contains spoilers for Power Book IV: Force Season 1 Episode 9.]</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Joesph-Sikora-Power-Force.jpg><h2 id=h-how-does-jenard-know-tommy-is-behind-dahlia>How does Jenard know Tommy is behind Dahlia?</h2><p id=par-3_84>In the episode, Marshall and D-Mac met up for the first time since their fight at the club. Marshall told him about how Jenard and Blaxton had betrayed him by cutting him out of the deal with Cousin Buddy. He was apologetic for how everything went down between them and asked D-Mac for help getting back at CBI. After D-Mac agreed, they went to meet Cousin Buddy. He agreed to set up a pipeline into Gary, Indiana, under the condition that he meet Tommy.</p><p id=par-4_70>Jenard was with Blaxton when he got a call about what D-Mac and Marshall had done. He was initially confused about how D-Mac got that much product. But then, remembering how D-Mac had backed out of spying on Tommy, Jenard realized it was probably because they had secretly started to work together. This coupled with the fact that Tommy sells drugs led him to believe that Tommy was behind Dahlia.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>D-Mac was targeted as a result in ‘Power Book IV: Force’ Episode 9</h2><p id=par-5_80>When Tommy got back, D-Mac was eager to tell him about the meeting with Cousin Buddy. He saw it as an opportunity for expansion, but Tommy thought the move was dumb and risky. While arguing with him, he told D-Mac that he knew he had vandalized JP’s store and that JP was his dad. It was a lot for D-Mac to process at first, but when he did, he wanted to meet with JP. Tommy agreed to set it up.</p><p id=par-6_54>They were walking out to the car when several masked men pulled up in a truck and started shooting. Tommy, pushing D-Mac out of the way, returned fire and shot and killed one of them. As the truck skirted off, Tommy rushed over to D-Mac, finding him with a gunshot wound to the stomach.</p><p id=par-7_39>Tommy then rushed him to a hospital, where D-Mac remains in serious condition. When JP arrived, Tommy came clean about D-Mac and who he really was. JP was shocked and angry and rushed inside to be with his son.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2>What to expect in the ‘Power Book IV: Force’ Season 1 finale</h2><p id=par-8_22>In the trailer for Power Book IV: Force Episode 10, JP asks Tommy to find out who shot D-Mac. Tommy happily accepts.</p><p id=par-9_42>The Flynn family, meanwhile, has brought in soldiers from Dublin and is prepared to go to war against Tommy. Walter Flynn has convinced Vic that Tommy was behind <a href=#>the attack on him and Gloria</a>, when really, he was likely the person responsible.</p><p id=par-10_11>Watch the show on Starz at 8 p.m. ET on Sundays.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9sMPEq2Sbp5%2BgeqrCjJ%2Bmq5uVYsCxu8ilnKtllp67pXnTqKSmsV2Zrqm4yJploaydoXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./i-m-legitimately-embarrassed-to-be-a-fan-of-this-show-cbs-devotee-calls-out-big-brother.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Im legitimately embarrassed to be a fan of this show: CBS devotee calls out Big Brother</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dawn-wells-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dawn Wells Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
