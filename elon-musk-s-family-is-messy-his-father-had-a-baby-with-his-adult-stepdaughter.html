As it turns out, he didn’t have the best childhood? Or maybe his childhood was just fine and he just loathes his father. It seems like Elon Musk’s father, Errol Musk (these names, my God) has a pretty messy romantic life as well. For some reason, the Musk family is getting the full tabloid treatment these days and the story broke over the weekend: Errol Musk had a child with his stepdaughter. My God.</p><p>The dad of tech billionaire Elon Musk says it was “God’s plan’’ for him to father the child he had with his stepdaughter. Errol Musk, 72, told The Sunday Times of London that 10-month-old Elliot is an “exquisite child.”</p><p>He claimed he did not think of Elliot’s mom, Jana Bezuidenhout, as his stepdaughter — since she was raised away from the family. Errol, who lives in South Africa, married Jana’s mother, Heide, when the girl was only 4. Years later, after they split, “One thing led to another — you can call it God’s plan or nature’s plan,” Errol said.</p><p>When she told him she was pregnant, Errol assumed her ex was the father and insisted on a DNA test. It proved Errol was the dad.</p><p>“Jana is a delightful girl and a wonderful mother,” he told the British paper. “She said I changed her life.” He said he helps support his 30-year-old stepdaughter and their son, adding he sees them regularly but does not live with them.</p><p>Elon, who heads Tesla and SpaceX, told Rolling Stone magazine last year, “My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil.” He added Errol is a “terrible human being.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six]</a></p><p>Errol Musk knew Jana since she was four years old and then they began a sexual relationship when she was in her late 20s and she got pregnant and he still didn’t believe he was the father. Basically. So Errol is the father AND step-grandfather to baby Elliot. Ew. Just… ew. I mean, everybody was a legal adult in this situation so it’s not illegal. It’s just really, profoundly disturbing. And now I am curious about Elon and Errol’s estrangement. Hm.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wenn33910221.jpg alt="Elon Musk during 'Elon Musk Answers Your Questions!' at SXSW" width=570 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbm9haoF0e8SlpqeXnarArL%2B%2Bn5imoZyurKq%2FvqacrKuplLWqv76fmK2glaesqa3DmJmamqmUxKrAx5ifoquPlrG2uNOYqq2doJmutrPHrZyrZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jep-robertson-wiki-biography-net-worth-age-family-facts-and-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jep Robertson Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Family, Facts and More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bubba-watson-is-taking-the-money-and-running-to-liv-golf-here-s-how-much-he-ll-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bubba Watson Is Taking The Money And Running To LIV Golf - Here's How Much He'll Make</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
