He planned a party, bought her a car, and fretted over what to wear to the ceremony. The trouble was, Priscilla didn’t want him there.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_52>“Elvis had a limo waiting for us out front,” Priscilla wrote in her book&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elvis and Me</a>. “But there was one problem: I did not want him to come to the actual ceremony. It would attract a lot of attention, and all eyes would be focused on him instead of the graduating seniors.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Priscilla-Presley-mother.jpg><p id=par-4_18>When she told him she didn’t want him there, she could tell he was hurt, but he agreed.</p><p id=par-5_66>“Finally I worked up enough courage to ask him to wait outside, and explain why,” she wrote. “Smiling his funny little grin, the one that came to his lips when he was hurt or upset, he agreed without hesitation. ‘I hadn’t thought about that,’ he said. ‘I won’t come in. I’ll just be outside in the car waiting for you. That way I’ll kinda be there.'”</p><p id=par-6_17>Priscilla was grateful for his agreement. While she wanted him there, she wanted to honor her achievement.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Priscilla Presley rushed to Elvis’ side after the graduation was over</h2><p id=par-7_18>After the ceremony concluded, Priscilla rushed outside to see Elvis. He hadn’t been entirely able to avoid attention.</p><p id=par-8_54>“As soon as I could get away, I ran outside,” she wrote. “In front of the church, Elvis and the boys were standing by the long black limo, looking like the Chicago Mafia in their dark glasses and suits, each concealing a .38. Around them a group of nuns were clamoring for Elvis’ autograph.”</p><p id=par-9_6>He praised her for her accomplishment.</p><p id=par-10_40>“When he looked up and saw me, he began applauding along <a href=#>with the boys</a>,” Priscilla wrote. “Hugging me, he told me how proud he was. He had me unroll the diploma so he could see it. I had finally graduated.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She was happy being done with school allowed her more time to be with Elvis</h2><p id=par-11_25>For Priscilla, graduation meant she had the freedom to dedicate her time to Elvis. She no longer had many major obligations outside of the relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Elvis-Priscilla.jpg><p id=par-12_58>“Now I could spend every minute with Elvis,” she wrote. “There were times when we’d shut ourselves off from the rest of the world for days. Elvis would leave word that he wanted ‘no calls unless it’s my daddy or an emergency call from Colonel.’ It was my time, and no one could interfere. He was all mine.”</p><p id=par-13_16>They called down for food, kept the curtains closed, and ignored the rest of the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9s7XSnKClpJFivbOx0qWcsmWcmsFuscuvoKxlkanBprrDZp%2Bin5hiwKS0zqijZp%2BilrG2rdOipqdmmKm6rXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-posehn-weight-loss-journey-diet-workout-routine-and-wife.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Brian Posehn Weight Loss Journey, Diet Workout Routine And Wife</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sacramento-jacob-clark-jendrock-missing-is-he-found-yet.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sacramento Jacob Clark-Jendrock Missing: Is He Found Yet?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
