After signing with Bad Boy Records, Sean “Diddy” Combs urged them to change the group’s name to The LOX. The LOX went on to have several chart hits, including their number-one single “Money, Power, & Respect” with DMX and Lil’ Kim and their feature on Jennifer Lopez’s “Jenny From the Block.”</p><p id=par-3_65>Much like The LOX, The Diplomats — a.k.a. Dipset — were also childhood friends with a love for rap. He brought the group together in the late 1990s and juggled recording music with the group and his own solo work for years. The Diplomats released their smash debut album Diplomatic Immunity in 2003 and the equally successful follow-up Diplomatic Immunity 2 the following year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jadakiss.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jadakiss-net-worth>Jadakiss’ net worth</h2><p id=par-4_46>Jadakiss’s solo career kicked off in 2001 with his debut album&nbsp;Kiss Tha Game Goodbye, which featured popular guests such as DMX, Eve,&nbsp;Snoop Dogg,&nbsp;Nas,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Swizz Beatz. The album sold over 200,000 copies in its first week and was certified gold with over half a million copies sold.</p><p id=par-5_63>Jadakiss’ second album&nbsp;Kiss of Death&nbsp;was released in 2004. The single&nbsp;“Why?” became one of the year’s biggest hits, eventually getting the remix treatment with Common, Nas, and his LOX groupmate Styles P. “Why?” peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and remains Jadakiss’ biggest hit to date, while another single from the record, “U Make Me Wanna” featuring&nbsp;Mariah Carey,&nbsp;peaked at number 21.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_40>In 2014, Jadakiss and&nbsp;Styles P&nbsp;wanted to give back to their community in a tangible way. They opened a juice bar in their hometown of Yonkers called Juices For Life, and went on to open two more branches in&nbsp;The Bronx&nbsp;and in&nbsp;Brooklyn.</p><p id=par-7_10>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>WealthyGorilla</a>, Jadakiss is worth approximately $6 million in 2021.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cam-ron-s-net-worth>Cam’ron’s net worth</h2><p id=par-8_80>Cam’ron first started rapping in the mid-1990s as part of the group Children of the Corn, consisting of a few of his friends from Harlem: Mase, Big L, and his cousin Bloodshed. The group disbanded in the late ’90s and Cam’ron quickly established a solo career, releasing his debut solo album&nbsp;Confessions of Fire&nbsp;in 1998. His second album,&nbsp;S.D.E. (Sports Drugs & Entertainment),&nbsp;was released in 2000 and had guest appearances from Destiny’s Child and his Dipset groupmates Juelz Santana and Jim Jones.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_48>Cam’ron released his&nbsp;hit album Come Home With Me in 2002, which featured guests such as Jay-Z and production from a young Kanye West. The album achieved platinum status with over 1 million copies sold. That same year, he went on to appear in the iconic movie&nbsp;Paid in Full.</p><p id=par-10_31>Cam’ron continued to release albums throughout the 2000s, with his most recent album,&nbsp;Purple Haze 2, being released in 2019. According to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>WealthyGorilla</a>, his net worth in 2021 sits at $8 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS5sMSMo5idmZuewLR51axknaGgqLK1ecKapKunnmLEqbXCoWSvnaKvwrt5wqikqZ2knsGwvoyhmKxlkWK1qrPHnqlmppWperi70a2fZ6Ckorlw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./will-brett-and-casey-s-relationship-end-in-heartbreak.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Will Brett and Caseys Relationship End in Heartbreak?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mary-louise-parker-s-net-worth-and-how-much-she-made-per-episode-on-weeds.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mary-Louise Parkers Net Worth and How Much She Made per Episode on Weeds</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
