Here's how much the gift would have cost in today's money, and the significance of the mirror.</p><p>Published on February 4, 2022</p><span></span><span>2 min read</span><p id=par-1_91><a href=#>1883</a> has had its fair share of violence and death so far. Fans were devastated when Ennis was killed in episode 5, taking away <a href=#>Elsa’s first love</a>. However, another romance is developing in the Yellowstone prequel. Noemi has taken an interest in Thomas and the Pinkerton Agent clearly has been thinking about her too. In 1883 Episode 6 he buys her an expensive mirror for a gift. But just how much would the mirror cost in today’s money, and why did Thomas buy it for Noemi in the first place?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1883-Noemi-and-Thomas.jpg><h2 id=h-thomas-buys-noemi-a-mirror-in-1883-episode-6>Thomas buys Noemi a mirror in ‘1883’ Episode 6</h2><p id=par-2_55><a href=#>Shea Brennan</a> and Thomas first took notice of Noemi after her husband was killed on the journey. The duo decided to look after Noemi and make sure she and her children make it to Oregon safely. Noemi later offers Thomas some stew and watches him eat, hinting she may have some real feelings for him.</p><p id=par-3_50>In <a href=#>1883 Episode 6</a>, Shea’s group reach a trading post. Thomas offers to take some of Noemi’s late husband’s possessions and sell them for her. At the trading post, he spots a beautiful mirror. He buys it for Noemi for $50, a very large amount of money in 1883.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2>How much was $50 worth in ‘1883’?</h2><p id=par-4_45>Unlike Taylor Sheridan’s modern-day series Yellowstone, 1883 is set over a century in the past. It’s easy to get confused by some things in the time period of the prequel series. For example, $50 in 1883 was worth a lot more than today’s money.</p><p id=par-5_49>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CPI Inflation Calculator</a> estimates that every $1 in 1883 is worth $27.60 in today’s money. This means that $50 back then would be the equivalent of $1,380 today. With this in mind, it’s easy to see why Thomas’ purchase of the mirror was such a big deal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1883-Thomas.jpg><p id=par-6_51>When Thomas gives the mirror to Noemi, he explains why he chose it for her. “Well, if I looked like you I figure I’d stare at myself every chance I got,” he told Noemi. LaMonica Garrett talked about Thomas’ decision to buy the mirror in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Insider.</a></p><p id=par-7_39>“That mirror was just something that caught his eye,” Garrett told the outlet. “He said it’s pretty, and it was pretty, but the explanation for it was a little awkward. And I think that’s funny, coming from Thomas.”</p><h2>Gratiela Brancusi explains the hidden significance of the mirror</h2><p id=par-8_44>Gratiela Brancusi plays Noemi in 1883. The actor further explained the significance of Thomas’ gift in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Line</a>. “The mirror tells her that she’s on his mind and in his heart even when she’s not around him,” the actor said.</p><p id=par-9_60>“We always joked, LaMonica and I, that it’s like an engagement ring. [Laughs] He wants her to see herself the way he sees her, because she struggles with feeling like a bad mother and a bad Roma woman and a bad widow, and I think he just sees a beautiful, bold woman, and he wants her to see that.”</p><p id=par-10_6>New episodes of&nbsp;1883&nbsp;release Sundays on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGR%2BeYSSZqSum5hignF5zKKpq6eiYsSwvtOhZK2nlJbGbr%2FEnKmerF2isqK6yKeeZpqVnbavsIygoJ%2BsXp3BrriO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hire-queen-for-a-corporate-event-or-performance-booking.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hire Queen for a Corporate Event or Performance Booking.</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./duane-allman-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Duane Allman Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
