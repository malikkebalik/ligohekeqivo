It was the number one single at the time, from her hit album&nbsp;Spellbound.&nbsp;Reeves agreed to take part, and together they recreated scenes from the classic James Dean movie,&nbsp;<a href=#>Rebel Without a Cause</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_44>In the long version of the music video, the pair share <a href=#>emotional dialogue</a> and spend a substantial amount of time making out. Fans pined over the heartfelt moments and swooned when Reeves said he didn’t know if he had ever been in love.</p><p id=par-5_38>The two enjoyed working together and had a lot of fun on set. <a href=#>Abdul did some acting</a> with Reeves, revealing that her favorite scene was the one where they were kissing each other at four in the morning.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaTOBmYGT3I</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Paula Abdul ever date Keanu Reeves?</h2><p id=par-6_23>Cohen asked Abdul if they ever dated, and she regrettably said no. Cohen responded, “Oh, that’s too bad” and Abdul said, “I know!”</p><p id=par-7_49>She talked about being on the set of “Rush, Rush” and wanting to introduce herself to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Reeves</a>&nbsp;since they had never met. She went to his dressing room trailer, and the door was slightly open. She peeked inside, to find him in his underwear with headphones on playing air guitar.</p><p id=par-8_17>Walking away, so as not to disturb him, she smiled to herself and said, “that’s my boyfriend.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why was Keanu Reeves playing air guitar?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_27>Keanu Reeves is <a href=#>no stranger to the air guitar</a>.

Ellen talked about their on-screen chemistry in the hit movie,&nbsp;Speed. She told Reeves that Bullock revealed she also had a crush on him.</p><p id=par-14_36>They never dated, but Bullock said she would giggle whenever he looked at her. This made it hard to be serious on the set.
