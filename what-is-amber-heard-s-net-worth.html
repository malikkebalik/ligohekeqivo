Then, following months of discourse on various social media sites, even longtime fans eventually stepped away from the drama and turned their attention to other things.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>The latest step in the pair’s legal battle — which is seeing Depp sue the Aquaman star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for defamation</a> over a 2018 Washington Post op-ed — began on April 11 and rekindled interest in Heard and Depp. The ultimate decision in the $50 million suit has people particularly curious about Heard’s financial situation as they ponder her ability to handle the continuous legal challenges, and the high payout.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>What is Amber Heard’s net worth?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Amber_Heard-1.jpg><p data-characters=614 data-current-count=914 data-injectable=true>The legal tussles between Heard and Depp have likely lightened Heard’s wallet somewhat, but the 35-year-old was, for awhile, in no way hurting for cash. Heard maintained a net worth of $8 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, up until she and Depp’s legal process concluded. Her accumulated wealth is the result of years of work in acting and modeling, starting as far back as the early 2000s. She’s since gained solid prominence in Hollywood, particularly after her debut in 2017’s Justice League as the Atlantean queen Mera welcomed Heard into the growing family of superhero stars.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Heard’s career slowed down somewhat in the wake of her and Depp’s contentious divorce, leading the actress to file for spousal support in 2016. She initially asked for a monthly stipend of $50,000 from Depp to cover various expenses, including rent, eating out, and pet supplies. She eventually withdrew the suit, leaving fans to further question her financial situation.</p><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=867 data-injectable=false>Following her loss to Depp in the defamation suit, Heard’s net worth plummeted. In the months since the final decision came through, Heard’s wealth has dropped from $8 million earlier in the year to a painful -$6 million, according to new figures from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. The cost of losing to Depp — and subsequently paying damages — resulted in an $8.35 million net loss for the star. This saw her net worth drop significantly and enter its current negative state.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZGir6a%2BjKGcmqqUqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./21-songs-you-definitely-cried-to-at-least-once-in-the-90s.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>21 Songs You Definitely Cried To At Least Once In The '90s</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-last-resort-season-2-coming-to-tlc.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Last Resort Season 2 Coming to TLC</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
