While he has appeared as the eccentric pirate Captain Jack Sparrow in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all five Pirates films</a> since in 2003, the fate of Depp’s involvement in future instalments was called into question amid his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">messy court battle</a> with ex-wife and actress, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amber Heard</a>.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Since then, reports have emerged around both the potential script and cast for Pirates of the Caribbean 6, including an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">all-female version starring Margot Robbie</a> (though this is currently on hold). Updates around whether Depp will reprise his role, however, remain relatively scarce. So, here’s everything we know about Johnny Depp’s return to Pirates of the Caribbean. &nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-will-johnny-depp-be-in-pirates-of-the-caribbean-6 data-injectable=false>Will Johnny Depp be in ‘Pirates of the Caribbean 6’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Johnny-Depp-as-Jack-Sparrow-in-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-.jpg><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>At the time of writing, there has been no official confirmation from either Disney (who are producing Pirates 6) or Depp as to whether the actor will return to the franchise. Speculation has persisted, however, after longtime Pirates producer Jerry Bruckheimer revealed his interest in seeing Depp sport the famous tricorn again.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=753 data-injectable=true>Bruckheimer told<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Entertainment Tonight</a> in 2023 that he would “love to have [Depp] in the movie,” but remained tight-lipped as to whether the actor was actually in talks to join the cast. Bruckheimer’s comments added to growing speculation that Depp himself was eyeing a Pirates return, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sources close to the actor</a> revealing that he would be open to reprising his role “if it’s the right project.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image-71.jpg><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>As for Disney’s role in Depp’s return, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> reported in 2023 that the company was leaving “the door open” for a potential collaboration with the actor, with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">former Disney executive saying</a> Pirates is “primed for rebooting [the franchise] with Johnny.” While these developments seem to point to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Sparrow reprisal</a>, conflicting reports still make Depp’s return to the franchise unclear.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>Amid his controversial defamtion trial, Depp <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">responded negatively to speculation</a> about a future role in Pirates 6, especially following his firing from the cast due to the abuse allegations. At the time, Depp said he had no plans of returning to the franchise, even if he was offered upwards of $300 million to reprise the role. It’s worth noting, however, that these comments came before claims that Depp’s attitude towards Disney had softened.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=false>In any case, updates around development of Pirates 6 have emerged irregardless of Depp’s involvement. We do know that multiple screenwriters have tried their hand at the script, including The Last of Us creator Craig Mazin, and that previous castmates Orlando Bloom and Kaya Scodelario will likely return to the franchise. An official release date for Pirates 6 has yet to be announced. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqKknGK3sLTNp7BmnJWlvW6uxGagp2Wgnr%2BiwMSsZKieXam1pnnCmqmimpKarq95lWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./a-palm-beach-property-once-owned-by-donald-trump-just-sold-for-close-to-140-million-second-most.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Palm Beach Property Once Owned By Donald Trump Just Sold For &amp;quot;Close To&amp;quot; $140 Million - Second Most</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./plastic-surgery-before-after-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Plastic Surgery Before After Photos</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
