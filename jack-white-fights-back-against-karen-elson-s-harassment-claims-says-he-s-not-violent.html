I’m still so disappointed in them! I thought their divorce was going to be restrained and hipster-cool, but it’s turning into one of the nastiest, most bitter custodial battles we’ve seen in a while. As we discussed on Friday, Karen’s side of the story is that Jack was threatening and harassing her via email, and she worried that he would turn violent, so she got a restraining order against him. But Jack White is fighting back legally and PR-wise.</p><p>First, TMZ got their hands on some of the emails Jack sent Karen – <a href=#>you can read them here</a>, if you want. Apparently, Jack really, really hates Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys and Jack doesn’t want to “lumped in together” with Dan and TBK. Their kids go to the same school, I guess, which was Karen’s decision. Jack also let TMZ know what this was really all about:</p><p>Jack White is adamant he is NOT a violent person nor is he a threat to his family — and his estranged wife was just trying to smear him when she got a restraining order … this according to legal docs.</p><p>Jack filed the docs in TN in response to the restraining order Karen Elson temporarily obtained against him — it’s all part of the couple’s nasty divorce that’s been going on since she filed last year.</p><p>In his docs, Jack says Karen often leaves the kids with him (as recently as last month) … arguing that’s not the behavior of a woman who believes he’s dangerous.</p><p>Jack also says Karen recently told a friend, “I’m completely in love with Jack and I’d move back tomorrow if he asked me.”</p><p>Jack’s convinced — Karen’s so-called fear was made up as a ploy to “malign him in the public record” … and wants to make it clear he’s not a “scary or violent person”.</p><p>Jack’s also asking a judge to establish a temporary parenting plan … since he and Karen clearly can’t come to an agreement themselves.</p><p><a href=#>[From TMZ]</a></p><p>Apparently, Jack <a href=#>also gave</a> the court some emails that Karen had written to him where she was complimenting his parenting style, saying, “You’re an amazing father, I’m so glad we had these kids together.” While the restraining order still stands – it was a temporary measure granted by a judge – it means that Jack can only contact Karen about their children and that’s it. Karen has filed legal papers claiming that Jack’s harassing emails were part of a “pattern of husband’s bullying wife into submission was a contributing factor in the demise of their marriage.”</p><p>As for these new wrinkles… I don’t know. I don’t really think anyone should lose custody of their kids just because they were venting some stuff out via email. I read some of the emails, and while Jack seems like a nitpicky bastard, he doesn’t seem harassing or violent at all. Temperamental? Sure. Pissed off about the custody arrangement? Sure. But it seems more like a guy who is venting than a guy who is threatening his ex. I don’t know. It seems like a messy custody fight rather than violence or the threat of violence.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wenn2402167.jpg alt title=wenn2402167 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/wenn2145225.jpg alt title=wenn2145225 width=520 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of PR Photos and WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbGlkZX1ye8mamqSXp522tbG%2Bn6CgoKSorKOtwqSWmp%2BRnru0wL6kmKudnpSyrb%2FOp6qYoJGnrrS%2FzJ6lrZeToa6qudKYqpqxo5S1pr%2B%2Bp6atl6aevK2xza1m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./korean-7-skin-method.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Korean 7-Skin Method</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fans-believe-this-character-s-death-is-one-of-the-show-s-worst-decisions.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fans Believe This Character's Death Is One of the Show's Worst Decisions</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
