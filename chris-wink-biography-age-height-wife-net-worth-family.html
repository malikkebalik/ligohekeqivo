The Blue School is a progressive independent school in New York City's South Street Seaport. The school began as an informal playgroup and has since expanded to include programs for children from the pre-primary through middle school levels.</p><p>The company's careful expansion, starting in 1995 in Boston at the Charles Playhouse and 1997 in Chicago's Briar Street Theatre, now extends internationally, with additional productions in Las Vegas, Orlando, and Berlin, as well as National and International Tours.</p><p>In 1991, Wink, Stanton, and Goldman opened "Blue Man Group: Tubes" at the Astor Place Theater. They expected the early shows would appeal only to the downtown scene, but soon they were adding performances and playing to sold-out crowds. Wink performed in over 1,200 shows without an understudy before they started to expand, training other performers in the qualities, humanity, and talents of the blue man. It was at this point that Wink and his co-founders started to consider other venues for their character.</p><p>Together with Wink's childhood friend <a href=#>Matt Goldman</a>, Stanton and Wink began performing as Blue Men in small downtown venues such as LaMaMa E.T.C. and P.S. 122. In 1988, Wink and his friends planned the very first Blue Man Group event, "Funeral for the 80’s," a procession through Central Park. There they set fire to what they considered the worst aspects of the decade, including a Rambo doll and a piece of the Berlin Wall. The event captured the interest of MTV, thrusting the character into the public consciousness.</p><p>Chris Wink (born 1961 in New York City, New York) is an American theater performer and director. He is one of the founding members of the Blue Man Group, as well as co-founder of Blue School. He has won numerous awards as a writer and performer, including a Grammy nomination, and is a frequent guest speaker on the topic of creativity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfmLWztdJmrqKmmw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dawn-wells-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dawn Wells Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sami-khedira-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sami Khedira Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
