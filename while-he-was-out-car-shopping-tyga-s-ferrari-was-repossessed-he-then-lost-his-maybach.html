Earlier this month, the California based rapper was in quite a bit of legal trouble <a href=#>when a warrant was issued</a> for his arrest, after he failed to show up for a court hearing regarding a lawsuit involving his former landlord and unpaid rent. He later paid the landlord $480,000, which helped him&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;being arrested&nbsp;in the process. While Tyga is out of the woods as it pertains that legal battle, the repo man paid him a visit earlier this week; and at an extremely inconvenient time.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Tyga was out Bentley shopping with his girlfriend <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> out in Calabasas earlier this week, and pulled up to the dealership in his fancy red Ferrari. They spent some time looking at looking at different cars before heading back to Tyga's Ferrari… Only to realize that the vehicle wasn't there anymore. Turns out the repo man rolled up to the Ferrari while Tyga and Kylie were car shopping, pulled out a spare key, and took the vehicle back.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-203969 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GettyImages-531107864-1.jpg alt="(Dave Kotinsky/Getty)" width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-203969 class=wp-caption-text>(Dave Kotinsky/Getty)</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>According to sources, Tyga missed "a couple" of his lease payments, and with Tyga's shaky resume of paying back people he owes money to, the lessor decided to take no chances; taking the car back in the process. Tyga and Kylie reportedly ended up getting a ride from one of his friends to get back home.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>This isn't the first time the repo man has come looking to Tyga's property. Earlier this year, the&nbsp;repo man was looking for a G Wagon he gifted Kylie for her 18th birthday. The repo company hasn't been able to gain access to the vehicle because it sits behind two security gates at Kylie's residence.</span></p><p class=p1>And it gets worse. Just a few days after he lost his Ferrari, a different repo man reportedly swooped in and took back Tyga's $2.2 million Maybach. Tyga had reportedly taken the car into a repair shop in Laguna Niguel, California. Then he stopped making payments on the car.</p><p class=p1>For most people, getting their car repossessed in front of their significant other would be a highly embarrassing situation. But something tells me that Tyga and Kylie are used to this kind of thing by now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnDA2KCYZp6Vp7%2BivshmqZ6on6jApr%2FSnptmm5GnerS0zqmnoqaXZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-was-ryan-gosling-dating-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How was Ryan Gosling Dating Life?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./in-n-out-heiress-speaks-out-in-rare-interview.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>In-N-Out Heiress Speaks Out In Rare Interview</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
