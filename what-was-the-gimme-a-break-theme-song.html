However, when it first aired on <a href=#>NBC</a> in 1981, it didn’t receive as much press as similar series like 227 and Diff’rent Strokes.</p><p id=par-2_31>The <a href=#>’80s sitcom</a> had a successful six-season run and a catchy theme song that showcased the show’s humor. So, what was Gimme a Break!‘s theme song, and who was behind it?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NBC-show-Gimme-a-Break.jpg><p id=par-3_56>Gimme a Break! was set in a fictional suburb called Glenlawn. The <a href=#>’80s show revolved</a> around Nell Carter’s character with the same first name, Nell Harper. Gimme a Break! begins after Nell’s dying friend Margaret Kanisky asks her to care for her family. Nell agrees and, with time, becomes a maternal figure to the Kanisky children.</p><p id=par-4_39>Nell also takes care of Margaret’s husband, Carl Kanisky, played by Dolph Sweet. In the third season, the series adds a foster son, Joey. Two seasons later, the show’s setting moves outside of Glenlawn and into New York City.</p><p id=par-5_45>This is after Joey moves in with his absentee father and a concerned Nell decides to visit them. After learning about the abject life Joey lives, Nell decides to take on a guardianship role caring for him and his little brother at their father’s behest.</p><p id=par-6_42>Notably, the actors who played Joey and Matthew are brothers in real life, played by Joey and Matthew Donovan. Taking up guardianship duties forces Nell to permanently take up <a href=#>residence in New York</a> after Carl’s father, Stanley Kanisky, sold the family home.</p><p id=par-7_64>This might have also been due to Sweet’s death during filming, which forced the writers to write him out of the script. The sitcom first aired on October 29, 1981, on NBC. Gimme a Break! had an impressive six-year run, airing for 137 episodes. Carter’s role on the series was her first time acting, but she nailed it, earning Emmy and Golden Globe nods.</p><h2 id=h-nell-carter-sang-the-theme-song-for-gimme-a-break>Nell Carter sang the theme song for ‘Gimme a Break!’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_35>Gimme a Break! had a catchy opening tune that gave viewers insight into the show. The song opens with a shot of the Kanisky household and quickly dives into Nell’s adventures as the Kanisky caretaker.</p><p id=par-9_44><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lyrics on Demand</a> breaks down the lyrics, highlighting the <a href=#>changes made to the song</a>. For the 1981-83 version, Nell speaks about wanting to make it to the top because she deserves it. She talks about wanting a happy ending and being tired of pretending.</p><p id=par-10_45>However, in the 1983-87 version, the lyrics indicate a shift in her thoughts and a new positive perspective on life. She sings, “I finally know where I belong.” Bob Garrett and Marley Sims wrote the first version of the theme song, which Bob Christianson composed.</p><p id=par-11_31>Richard Page wrote the second version, and Jay Graydon composed it. Carter, who won a Tony Award in 1978 for her role in Ain’t Misbehavin, sang both versions of the song.</p><h2 id=h-how-did-nell-carter-die>How did Nell Carter die?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_32>In 2003, Carter’s spokesperson confirmed that she died after battling diabetes. The reports stated that the legendary icon collapsed at her home in Beverly Hills. Her 13-year-old son discovered her that night.</p><p id=par-13_33>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LA Times</a> reported that there wasn’t an autopsy completed on Carter’s body, which aligned with her wishes. LA County nonetheless deduced a probable cause using X-rays, blood tests, and her medical history.</p><p id=par-14_34>The coroner ruled out any foul play, stating that Carter <a href=#>died of heart disease</a> with diabetes being a significant contributor. No illegal drugs were found in her system at the time of her death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZq6aq12ptaZ5xqKkpp1dlnqjvsSaomasmJq6pnnSqKWgZpipuq17</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-bobby-flay-s-daughter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Bobby Flays daughter?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tracy-anderson-lies-claims-she-s-always-approved-of-walking-as-a-workout.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tracy Anderson lies, claims shes always approved of walking as a workout</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
