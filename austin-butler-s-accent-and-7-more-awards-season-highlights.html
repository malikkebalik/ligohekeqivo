This is pretty epic."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">It was the perfect way to launch what would become <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">one of the biggest hits of the year,</a> taking a staggering $1.4bn (£1.16bn) at the global box office.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">That figure was eclipsed only by Avatar: The Way of Water, which took $2.27bn (£1.89bn) - but James Cameron's sci-fi epic had the considerable advantage of being released in China, <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">which Top Gun wasn't.</a></p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">2. Michelle Yeoh threatening to beat you up</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/126C6/production/_128826457_gettyimages-1246140934-1.jpg.webp alt="Getty Images Michelle Yeoh" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">Getty Images</span><span class="sc-cdeb84b0-0 bRiQvM">Michelle Yeoh with her Golden Globe trophy, which we totally believe she could use effectively as a weapon</span><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">One issue that springs up every year is the time limit awards producers impose on acceptance speeches - with many winners regularly going over their allotted 45 seconds.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">When the Golden Globes attempted to wrap Michelle Yeoh up by playing walk-off music in January, <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">the actress told them from the stage:</a> "Shut up please. I can beat you up, and that's serious."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">To be fair, she had been talking for a full two minutes by this point, and continued for another two after successfully batting away the music.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But having seen her performance in Everything Everywhere All At Once, we don't doubt Yeoh could've easily held her own in a scrap.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">3. Austin Butler maintaining his accent</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3C66/production/_128826451_butlergettyimages-1467694562.jpg.webp alt="Getty Images Austin Butler at the Bafta Film Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">Getty Images</span><span class="sc-cdeb84b0-0 bRiQvM">Every time Butler gave an acceptance speech this season, viewers commented on how much he still sounds like Elvis</span><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The Elvis star's real-life speaking voice was the biggest shock since Killing Eve fans found out Jodie Comer was actually from Liverpool.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Butler grew up in Anaheim, California, some distance from Presley's Mississippi roots, but became so immersed in his role as the legendary singer in Baz Luhrmann's biopic that he continued talking like Elvis long after filming had wrapped.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"I had three years where that was my only focus," he told reporters at the Golden Globes. "So I'm sure there are pieces of him in my DNA, and I'll always be linked."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">We're OK with Butler hanging on to his gravelly timbre and southern drawl. If he ever leaves acting behind, we would warmly endorse him launching a new career hosting every podcast and voicing every audiobook.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">4.

Perfect pairings</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/360A/production/_128843831_jennaaubreygettyimages-1247520792.jpg.webp alt="Getty Images Jenna Ortega and Aubrey Plaza at the SAG Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">Getty Images</span><span class="sc-cdeb84b0-0 bRiQvM">Jenna Ortega and Aubrey Plaza provided the biggest viral moment of the SAG Awards with their deadpan routine</span><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">This year's Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards was one of the most entertaining precursor ceremonies, attracting praise from film fans for letting acceptance speeches run long and not attempting to play anybody off.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The SAGs had the luxury of airing on Netflix's YouTube channel after the streamer took over the rights from the previous broadcast network, which meant producers didn't have to worry about timings or ad breaks.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">The ceremony also gave us some of the best category presentations of the season - with perfect pairings such as Zendaya and Paul Mescal sending social media into overdrive.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But the highlight <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">was a brilliantly deadpan sequence</a> from The White Lotus star Aubrey Plaza and Wednesday's Jenna Ortega. The pair stood awkwardly and complained they had nothing in common, before speaking in perfect unison and suddenly understanding why fans have drawn similarities between them.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">6. Ariana DeBose's Bafta rap</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1556/production/_128826450_debosegettyimages-1467663658.jpg.webp alt="Getty Images Ariana DeBose performing at the Bafta Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">Getty Images</span><span class="sc-cdeb84b0-0 bRiQvM">Ariana DeBose shouted out female nominees in a rap at the Bafta awards</span><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Now look here, we will not tolerate any jokes about this one, so stop sniggering at the back.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Every year we hear complaints that awards ceremonies don't do anything fun, different or original to keep viewers entertained, so DeBose deserves credit for taking a big swing this year with her own rap paying tribute to the female nominees at the Baftas.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Kicking off the ceremony, DeBose praised the performances of actresses such as Ana de Armas and Jamie Lee Curtis, in a verse that memorably featured the immortal words: "Angela Bassett did the thing / Viola Davis my Woman King."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">She might have been out of breath, her pronunciation of certain names might have been questionable, but we salute you Ariana and request that you are booked again for next year.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">7. Cate Blanchett hiding under a table</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.bbc.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1FBE/production/_128862180_cropgettyimages-1471366665.jpg.webp alt="Getty Images Cate Blanchett attends the 2023 Film Independent Spirit Awards on March 04, 2023 in Santa Monica, California" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="sc-a898728c-2 WCrKn">Getty Images</span><span class="sc-cdeb84b0-0 bRiQvM">Cate Blanchett: Good at winning awards, less good at taking part in quirky award show sketches</span><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">This year's Independent Spirit Awards provided several golden moments, including Women Talking director <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">Sarah Polley's comedic response to Mark Wahlberg</a> getting the name of her film wrong when he introduced it at the SAG ceremony.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">But many of the Indie Spirit highlights came from host Hasan Minhaj, who delivered some genuinely funny jokes... but also some bits that didn't land.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">In one attempt to create a viral moment, Minhaj said to the audience: "Let's get some YouTube views. I'm going to throw you a few clickbaity titles and you give me that YouTube thumbnail face."</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Cate Blanchett, however, was not in the mood to take part, <a href=# class="sc-c9299ecf-0 bZUiKB">so hid under her table</a> as the host attempted to engage her.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">Undeterred, Minhaj asked director Todd Field and actresses Marisa Tomei and Regina Hall to pull faces instead. But all of them clearly thought Blanchett had the right idea, and promptly crawled under the same table.</p><h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 kRvAla">8.

And I probably should have left a trail of breadcrumbs. But you found me,"</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">A month later, at the SAG Awards, he voiced words of encouragement to other struggling actors. "I just want you to know, all the actors out there who have gone through that or are going through that, I know how you feel," he said.</p><p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fYAfXe">"But believe me, if you just stay in there and put one foot in front of the other, you'll get to where you need to go."</p>BBC in other languages<span data-testid=level1NavText-/innovation class="sc-7be630a6-3 dyMECJ">Innovation</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o67CZ5qopV%2Bjsri%2Fjp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1lkafBtHmVbW9raWhmhg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gabriel-casseus-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gabriel Casseus Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-glycine-what-are-its-benefits.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Glycine &amp;amp; What Are Its Benefits?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
