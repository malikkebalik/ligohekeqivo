She’s had so many legendary roles that <a href=#>TV</a>’s <a href=#>The Facts of Life</a> may not make many headlines.

She took over when Charlotte Rae left after seven seasons. Here’s why Rae left and Leachman decided to join the show.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-before-cloris-leachman-the-facts-of-life-was-a-diff-rent-strokes>Before Cloris Leachman, ‘The Facts of Life’ was a ‘Diff’rent Strokes’</h2><p id=par-3_48>Edna Garrett (Rae)’s story began on Diff’rent Strokes. She was the Drummonds’ housekeeper. The Facts of Life began with Mrs. Garrett becoming the housemother of a girls school. Mrs. Garrett was a mother figure to Blair (Lisa Whelchel), Tootie (Kim Fields), Natalie (Mindy Cohen) and Jo (Nancy McKeon).</p><p id=par-4_53>Over the years, the girls graduated school but remained on the show. Mrs. Garrett opened Edna’s Edibles. The girls worked for her there, but when the shop burned down, they became partners converting it to Over Our Heads. After seven seasons, Rae decided not to renew her contract and NBC brought in Leachman.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-charlotte-rae-left-the-facts-of-life>Why Charlotte Rae left ‘The Facts of Life’</h2><p id=par-5_71>In the two part season 8 premiere, Mrs. Garrett reunited with Bruce Gaines (Robert Mandan), an old flame from her time in the Peace Corps. They married and Mrs. Garrett left for Africa to continue their Peace Corps work. Leachman played Garrett’s sister, Beverly Anne Stickle. Stickle took over Garrett’s duties at Over Our Heads. In an Oct. 17, 1986 interview with the Orlando Sentinel, via <a href=#>Newspapers.com</a>, Rae explained her departure.</p><p id=par-6_79>“Sometimes it’s just time to move on,” Rae told the Sentinel. “The show is wonderfully popular and the public loves all the characters, but I just felt I had done all that I could do with Mrs. Garrett. It’s just like Jean Stapleton deciding to leave the role of Edith Bunker when she did. I felt I had investigated every nook and cranny, and for my own stimulation as an actress, it was important for me to move on.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Facts-of-Life.jpg><p id=par-7_17>Rae already had big plans in 1986. The Facts of Life was in good hands with Leachman.</p><p id=par-8_36>“I have a production company, and I have a writer doing a script treatment on a book that I think would make a wonderful feature film,” Leachman continued. “I would be one of the stars, though.”</p><p id=par-9_26>The only thing she did not want to do again was play “an awful lot of Mrs. Garrett-type roles, which I have carefully refused to do.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cloris-leachman-wanted-back-in-with-television>Cloris Leachman wanted back in with television&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-10_34>The <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a> interviewed Leachman for an article on Oct. 14, 1986 about joining The Facts of Life. True to her irreverent nature, Leachman couldn’t even keep the title of the show straight.</p><p id=par-11_18>“All the names of these shows are so similar,” Leachman told the Times. “I can’t tell them apart.”</p><p id=par-12_18>Leachman was making a conscious move to get back into television a decade after her Phyllis spinoff ended.</p><p id=par-13_14>“I thought, it’s time to get back and say ‘Cloris is here,’” Leachman said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Facts-of-Life-Stacey-Q.jpg><p id=par-14_30>NBC made sure she was well compensated, Leachman said of “a considerable amount of money” she received. She said they figured out the character of Stickle once she got there.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_44>“None of us really knew who I was going to be,” Leachman said. “Then, once I was cast, I think they looked in on me. My own fun that I have in my own life with whatever I’m doing–they’re catching that in my character.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqcWMnaCdZZOhvLO10majnpmTnbqiuoyrnKmkkZiybq%2FHmqmlp6Spsm6%2BwJ5kqKZdqbWmecWamq2rXaSzbrjIn5xnoKSiuXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-is-rebekah-jones-son-arrested-learn-more-about-rebekah-jones-son-s-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Is Rebekah Jones Son Arrested?
