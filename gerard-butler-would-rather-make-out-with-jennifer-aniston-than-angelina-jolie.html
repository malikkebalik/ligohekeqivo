It was a good seven or eight years ago. I was really into him. My crush died over time, but I still held some general affection for him, from afar. Gerard Butler could have been a huge deal but he made too many bad movies and he said yes to every script that came his way. He’s currently promoting Den of Thieves, which I’m not going to watch. I’m including some photos from last night’s premiere in this post – he walked the carpet with his on-again girlfriend, Morgan Brown. They’ve been doing the on-and-off thing for years now.</p><p>To promote this latest film, Butler (G-But) appeared on What What Happens Live. Suffice to say, Ol’ G-But was reminded of the fact that he’s one of the few actors to act against both Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston, and he got to kiss them both on-screen (Jolie in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Aniston in Bounty Hunter). During the Plead the Fifth game, Butler was asked which woman was the better kisser. From The Daily Mail:</p><p>The 48-year-old Scottish actor participated in a Plead The Fifth game where he was asked by the 49-year-old host which between the star actresses is better to smooch.</p><p>As he had already plead the fifth once, he looked pained to have to answer as he finally said: ‘Jennifer Aniston. I’m just going, you know, I’m just taking you by surprise.’</p><p><a href=#>[From The Daily Mail]</a></p><p>There you go: Ol G-But thought Jennifer Aniston was the better kisser. Boom. The Team Jolie/Team Aniston War shall never die. Here’s the video:</p><p></p><p>In this clip, Butler talks about weird places he’s had sex. Um, <a href=#>the porta-potty never comes up</a>!</p><p></p><p><a id=oaIfx7wzQ8tWofQIYlMHPQ class=gie-single href=#>Embed from Getty Images</a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/wenn5452484.jpg alt="Jennifer Aniston, Gerard Butler" width=490 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Getty, WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbm5jaINze8aeqZqqlJSvtsDLnqmYr5%2BquaWr0ZqroZ2ilLqit8SYpq6sj6y2tbS%2Bo5ynppmbsrOrwKegrKyfo6y1tMCnlpqml5q5qrrAmKGopJmafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeff-bezos-is-reportedly-dating-tv-host-lauren-sanchez-the-former-wife-of-hollywood-talent-mogul-p.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeff Bezos Is Reportedly Dating TV Host Lauren Sanchez - The Former Wife Of Hollywood Talent Mogul P</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cub-cadet-102-specs-price-review-attachments-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cub Cadet 102 Specs, Price, Review &amp;amp; Attachments 2022</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
