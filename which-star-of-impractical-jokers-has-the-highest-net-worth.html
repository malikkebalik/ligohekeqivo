Starring Joe Gatto, Sal Vulcano, Brian “Q” Quinn, and James “Murr” Murray, the show focuses on four lifelong best friends who challenge each other to do <a href=#>seriously embarrassing stunts</a> in public. At the end of the show, the person with the most losses has to take a punishment created by the others.</p><p id=par-2_40>The stars have become a pretty big deal since the series debuted in 2011 and are now rolling in the dough, both from their show salaries and a few successful side gigs. But which star has t<a href=#>he highest net worth</a>?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/James-Murray-Joe-Gatto-Sal-Vulcano-and-Brian-Quinn.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Joe Gatto’s net worth</h2><p id=par-3_39>According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Joe’s net worth is $5 million. Reports say that he and his co-stars earn $50,000 per episode and make money while touring as their comedy troupe, The Tenderloins, which formed in the ’90s.</p><p id=par-4_23>Joe and his pals also appear in the TBS series The Misery Index, which debuted in October 2019 and is hosted by&nbsp;Jameela Jamil.</p><p id=par-5_39>In comparison to his co-stars, Joe seemingly hasn’t branched out as much on his own and pursued solo projects. A true family man, he likes to live a calm and quiet life with his wife, two children, and dogs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sal Vulcano’s net worth</h2><p id=par-6_58>Like his buddy Joe, Sal’s net worth is also $5 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Outside of the truTV and TBS series, Sal spends a lot of his time recording material for his and Q’s podcast, What Say You. He also does stand-up comedy and acts, having appeared in TV shows such as 12 Monkeys and Bones.</p><p id=par-7_56>“My job is literally to write jokes and to laugh,” he told <a href=#>Deseret News</a> in 2018 “Like, I just got a mortgage and it’s from that. So I can’t believe that. It’s what people say to us the most, both in celebration of the fact that we did it and in resentment that we’re doing it.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brian “Q” Quinn’s net worth</h2><p id=par-8_44>When he’s not filming TV shows or working on podcasts, Q keeps busy with hosting and small acting gigs. According to <a href=#>his Instagram page</a>, Q appeared in the Jay And Silent Bob Reboot&nbsp;(2019) and served as <a href=#>a correspondent at Wrestlemania 34</a> in 2018.</p><p id=par-9_28>Even so, it appears that much of his money and success comes from Impractical Jokers because his reported net worth is also $5 million, per Celebrity Net Worth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>James “Murr” Murray’s net worth</h2><p id=par-10_56>Murr is not only a television star but also a published author. In 2018, he published a critically-acclaimed supernatural thriller, Awakened, with horror writer Darren Wearmouth. Murr said in a later interview with the radio station <a href=#>Z100 New York</a> that the book is a trilogy, meaning a new one will come out each year until 2021.</p><p id=par-11_30>Given the success of the book, it seems like he’s made a boatload of cash from it. Still, his net worth is the same as that of his friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbXCoWSsrJGnerCyjKKkqaqRmMGqr8ClZKOnm5q%2FtHnHmqpmrJiaeqm1xqGcrKxdo7K1edaoqa2gXp3BrriO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./apex-legends-pick-rates-reveal-season-3-s-least-popular-character.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Apex Legends Pick Rates Reveal Season 3s Least Popular Character</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./release-date-cast-and-how-to-watch-the-disney-series.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Release Date, Cast, and How to Watch the Disney+ Series</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
