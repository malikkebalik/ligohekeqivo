Harris attended the Jesuit school Crescent College, where he played rugby. He was forced to stop playing the sport after he caught tuberculosis. After his recovery, Richard relocated to Great Britain with hopes of becoming a director, but he couldn't find a suitable training course, so he began studying acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. As a student, he rented the Irving Theatre, a small "off-West End" performance space, and directed a production of Clifford Odets' "Winter Journey (The Country Girl)." Harris later became involved with Joan Littlewood's Theatre Workshop and began appearing in West End productions such as "The Quare Fellow" (1956).</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Richard's first film was 1959's "Alive and Kicking," and he followed it with "Shake Hands with the Devil" (1959), "The Wreck of the Mary Deare" (1959), "A Terrible Beauty" (1960), "The Guns of Navarone" (1961), "The Long and the Short and the Tall" (1961), "Mutiny on the Bounty" (1962), "Red Desert" (1964), "The Bible: In The Beginning" (1966), and "Caprice" (1967).
