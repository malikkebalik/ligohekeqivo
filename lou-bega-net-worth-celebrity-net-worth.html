According to the website AllMusic, "He sang and danced as a child, listened to R&B and reggae as a teenager, and was in a rap group, but a trip to Miami as an 18-year-old acquainted him with the songs of the mambo kings of the '30s and '40s. Fascinated by mambo's sounds and stylish fashions, Bega returned to Germany and created his own version of the music." Lou also spent six months living in Uganda.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>When Bega was 13 years old, he formed a hip-hop group with two of his friends, and they released a CD in 1990.

I played that a lot. I had the dance mix. I loved those extended play things and I played both sides of it. And one of them was just total instrumental." King added, "And I played that thing until my wife just said, 'One more time, and I'm going to fâ€”â€” leave you.'"</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 2019, TV 2 Denmark interviewed Lou for its "Guds bedste bÃ¸rn" documentary series, and he spoke about his religion.
