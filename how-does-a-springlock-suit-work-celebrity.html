In order to turn the animatronic into “suit mode”, you will require a special crank which pushes the endoskeleton and other robotic bits into the sides of the suit, making just enough space to fit a person inside.</p><p>When the spring in the Springlock is compressed, it moves a rod until locking into place, and it takes the animatronic parts attached to it with it, eventually securing them against the sides of the suit.</p><p>Would a spring lock suit (like in Five Nights at Freddy’s) be possible in real life? A FNAF type spring-lock suit would be possible, but not the exact way described in FnaF. First of all, the spring mechanisms cannot output enough power for prolongued activity.</p><p>Basically, spring lock suits are made up of plastic, metal and fabric. The plastic and metal are the animatronic components. These components can be pushed back by spring locks, which are basically exactly what they sound like; springs that lock into position. These locks push back the animatronic components</p><h2>What is the purpose of the Springlock suit in Sister Location?</h2><p>A Springlock suit makes an appearance in Sister Location. Circus Baby uses it to hide Michael Afton after<strong> Funtime Foxy knocked</strong> him out. she then opens the faceplates to reveal Michael to the security cameras so people could find him, however it also reveals his location to the Minireenas. Michael has to shake them off while also rewinding the springlocks so he’s not the next victim of a Springlock failure.</p><p>There are two known reasons Springlock failures can occur, one of these is when<strong> the springlocks interact with water and moisture, for this reason employees must not wear the suit in rooms with too much moisture in the air.</strong></p><p>The<strong> Springbonnie suit</strong> now known as Springtrap makes an appearance as the main antagonist of the game, Springtrap would later be revealed to be the old Springbonnie suit and the decomposing corpse of William Afton after a Springlock failure, Phone Guy also mentions the the<strong> Springbonnie suit</strong> has been moved, further hinting that Springbonnie was used by William to murder the 5 missing children.</p><p>A<strong> “Springlock failure”</strong> is one of the many incidents that has happened at Fazbear entertainment restaurants over the years. These incidents occur when the locks, that are holding the endoskeleton in the folded position, break. This causes the endoskeleton to spring into its usual position, anyone caught inside the suit when this happens will be impaled and crushed by the parts. It is, however, possible to escape the suit before the injuries become fatal as shown by William in the novels.</p><p><strong>Springtrap,</strong> now known as scraptrap returns in Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria Simulator as an antagonist once again, he is destroyed once and for all when Henry burns down the establishment, it is implied that William is now burning in hell for what he has done.</p><p><strong>Due to</strong> Golden Freddy<strong> being a</strong> Springlock Suit,<strong> there appear to be no visual indicators on which suits contain Springlocks. All Springlock suits seen externally so far in the games are golden. It is</strong> unknown<strong> however if the Springlock suit in Sister Location is golden as it is always</strong> seen<strong> inside of it.</strong></p><p>This causes the endoskeleton to spring into its usual position, anyone caught inside the suit when this happens will be impaled and crushed by the parts. It is, however, possible to escape the suit before the injuries become fatal as shown by William in the novels.

These components can be pushed back by spring locks, which are basically exactly what they sound like; springs that lock into position.</p><p>Nobody would build a spring lock suit that has the potential of snapping shut and injuring the wearer. We have safety regulations and many many many companies that will shut anyone down if that suit is not 100% safe to wear. And those safety regulations are the exact reason why we don’t have spring suits.</p><p>When the animatronic parts have been pushed back by the spring locks,<strong> a human</strong> can wear the suits. When they are not pushed back, the suit is fully animatronic. These locks can easily be.

You need sensors to keep balance, and shock absorbers to keep the suit from losing that balance by walking. Spring-locks are good , but only for static bots.

First of all, the spring mechanisms cannot output enough power for prolongued activity.</p><h2>How to change a springlock suit?</h2><p>The springlock suits are composed of several individual spring-powered locking mechanisms, hence the name “springlock.” When one wishes to change a springlock suit from its animatronic form into its suit form, one must insert a hand crank into its designated slot and proceed<strong> to turn it firmly into its position.</strong> Doing so will proceed to<strong> coil the springs</strong> into their<strong> suit</strong> positions, causing the endoskeleton parts to be compressed and locked around the sides of the suit.</p><p>Phone Guy mentions that there were<strong> “temporary”</strong> suits used after the decommissioning of the springlock suits, with a possible example being a Spring Bonnie-based suit that is implied William Afton used in the missing children incident would become the basis for William Afton’s digital consciousness .</p><p>The third game mentions that there are<strong> two</strong> springlock suits; one is Spring Bonnie and the other is Fredbear . Seen during the events of the end-of-night minigames in Five Nights at Freddy’s 4, the springlock suits are mainly used for the older restaurant Fredbear’s Family Diner .</p><p>In the sixth game, the<strong> Spring Bonnie suit</strong> Afton wore as Scraptrap is completely different, making it possible that there are differently-designed springlock suit models of Spring Bonnie or it was a prototype.</p><p>Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria Simulator.
