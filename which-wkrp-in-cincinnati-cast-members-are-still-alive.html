Before his <a href=#>death</a> from pulmonary fibrosis, he appeared in dozens of popular classic TV shows. The long list includes Green Acres, Mannix, The Partridge Family, <a href=#>The Brady Bunch</a>, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and Seinfeld. Before landing the role of Arthur Carlson on WKRP in Cincinnati in 1978, Jump had worked at radio and TV stations, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>.

In addition to acting in other ’80s shows like <a href=#>Fantasy Island</a>, Bonner also directed episodes of WKRP in Cincinnati, Family Ties, Who’s the Boss?, and Saved by the Bell: The New Class. He died in June 2021 at age 79 after experiencing complications from Lewy body dementia. This type of dementia leads to a breakdown in thinking, reasoning, and independent function. <a href=#>Robin Williams also had Lewy body dementia</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Here’s what Gary Sandy, Tim Reid, and Richard Sanders are doing now</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-6></figure><p id=par-7_74>Gary Sandy’s big break was on <a href=#>As The World Turns</a> in a role that was written specially for him.
