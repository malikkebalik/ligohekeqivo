Way to Stay Relevant Baseball, Hot Seat/Cool Throne, Bachelor Talk, Zillion Beers, and more. In addition to all of that, actor Miles Teller joined Mr. Cat and Mr. Commenter to discuss his film career, his passion for the Philadelphia Eagles, Glenny Balls, and today's burning question: Is Miles Teller an asshole? The fellas opened up an investigation:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mr. Commenter: Do you watch your own movies?</strong></p><p><strong>Miles Teller: I watch them once with just like a small group: my publicist, my agent Kelly, my wife, and yeah, it's pretty uncomfortable. Like even the first time we saw Whiplash, you know, you work on something for so long [Whiplash was like 19 days], you know it's months and months and it's like an experience, all this shit. And then it's cut down to a two hour movie and it's like, that's what I look like, I hate listening to my voice, all this stuff. And then I'll watch it at the premiere and that's just being kind of professional. Every once in a while I'll be sitting there with a good buzz. and I'll be like, "Oh the movie's on, let me watch this shit." And then I'll be like, "Turn this off, oh my gosh."</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Commenter: It would probably be uncomfortable watching Whiplash...</strong></p><p><strong>Miles Teller: Do you listen to your own podcast? Do you watch your stuff back?</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Cat and Mr. Commenter: No, can't do it. Never, ever.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Miles Teller: That's like reading your mentions, something like that. Everyone's just pretty, I don't know...&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/chumley.barstoolsports.com/union/2020/02/12/09253ee5.jpg sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 776px" loading=eager style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Mr. Commenter: So you don't search your name on Twitter to see what people are saying?</strong></p><p><strong>Miles Teller: No, not really. I guess maybe if I'm seeing if something was like, bad.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Cat: Do you want us to do it for you? We could search for you.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Miles Teller: I mean, however you guys want to spend this time.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Commenter: This is a perfect way to spend this time. This is great, great podcasting.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Cat: "Honestly Miles Teller fucking sucks. How do I know this? He's exactly to the "TEE" the type of guy I'd fall for." Oh, that took a turn. Damn. I thought I got you there. Fuck. Shit. Alright, so that woman likes you a lot. "Yo Miles Teller fucking sucks LMAO." I don't know what you did to that guy. So yeah, you should check this. Just to stay humble.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Miles Teller: I mean, do you want to know just like what a bunch of random people are thinking about you?</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Cat: Sometimes. Well, the good ones.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Commenter: This one is, "ya con que este Miles Teller hace que la pelicula valga la pena."</strong></p><p><strong>Miles Teller: So, you'll put that up on a translation when you guys cut this together?</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Commenter: It just means, "Miles Teller is a dick. And he has too many fantasy teams." That's the direct translation.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Miles Teller: I'll take your word for it. I dropped AP Calculus and went to French I. That's kind of a humble brag.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Cat: No, that's a brag brag. I like that.</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Commenter: Here's a good one. This is from Husky Dave Grohl, "Just peed next to Miles Teller." Do you remember that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Miles Teller: There was a guy kind of staring...</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Cat: Looking like Dave Grohl...</strong></p><p><strong>Miles Teller: That's why you got to stay off of that. The Internet is a scary place, man.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Mr. Commenter: He got 40 likes off that. That's the best way to chase clout is just to piss next to you.</strong></p><p>Ah, the art of social media. It can be magnificent, it can be toxic. It has brought a lot of good to the world, and a lot of... not so good. For these big actors, it must be interesting knowing that there pretty much always seems to be fans discussing what intersection they saw you on, what you had for dinner, and in Miles Teller's case, who is keeping him company when he is taking a piss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o63RrKuop5yovbC%2B06xlnKedZK%2Btu8ZoaHFtZGuCenvIrGSmoZyawG7AxKWjnqpdlrturdKsn6iklWKxsLnAoqWYbl2Xv6atyqxkoqxdmby4ug%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-kardashian-and-kylie-jenner-make-a-disgusting-amount-of-money-for-one-instagram-post.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Kardashian And Kylie Jenner Make A Disgusting Amount Of Money For One Instagram Post</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./denis-o-hare-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Denis O'Hare Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
