Still, the headline surprised me: Zoe Kravitz was seen out with Chris Pine, and they looked very friendly. Pine and Kravitz have been friends for years and they reportedly dated at one point more than a decade ago, although I don’t think it was anything super-serious. If they had a friends-with-benefits situation at some point, I would not be surprised. These days, Zoe is pretty serious with Channing Tatum and Chris is pretty serious with Annabelle Wallis. Annabelle and Channing were not at dinner with their partners though:</p><p>Zoë Kravitz grabbed dinner with rumored ex Chris Pine in Los Angeles on Saturday — an outing that comes amid the actress’ apparent romance with Channing Tatum. Wearing nearly identical suede jackets, Kravitz, 32, and Pine, 41, were photographed exiting West Hollywood’s Sushi Park restaurant, a favorite A-lister spot. Before departing, they were spotted sharing a warm embrace.</p><p>The pair were first linked in 2010 after spending time together at that year’s Met Gala. Three years later, dating speculation swirled as they attended several events at London Fashion Week together. However, neither party ever confirmed a romance on the record.</p><p>Pine was present for Kravitz’s 2019 wedding to actor Karl Glusman, from whom she finalized her divorce in August.</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six]</a></p><p>As I said, this felt more scandalous a few days ago. Now I’m thinking it was just two friends going out to dinner. Maybe Channing had other sh-t to do and maybe Annabelle did as well. It’s not like Zoe and Chris were canoodling, nor is anyone saying that they were trying to be furtive. They weren’t hiding, she hugged him knowing that a photographer was there, so it’s probably fine. Dudes and ladies are allowed to be friends!!</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Zoë Kravitz hangs with rumored ex Chris Pine amid Channing Tatum romance <a href=#>https://t.co/N0dPQXfAEX</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vC9fV2IKHW</a></p><p>— Page Six (@PageSix) <a href=#>November 25, 2021</a></p><p><a id=Jc6Kuv0dT0JdQ-xnDc7tXg class=gie-single href=#>Embed from Getty Images</a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Getty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcGxjaX53e8KhqaKrj6W2r7G%2Bs6ael5unrre107OWsJ2eqaywwdOYq6iXlJ67r7HRmK6irJikwrWr06GcoqqPp7K0vMScq6KulZS9or7Tp5yrq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ftx-hired-private-planes-to-fly-amazon-packages-to-the-bahamas-report.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>FTX Hired Private Planes to Fly Amazon Packages to the Bahamas: Report</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./can-i-pay-rent-with-a-credit-card.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Can I Pay Rent With a Credit Card?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
