Bob Brinker has been working as an expert in the investment management business for over quarter of a century and is probably most famous for presenting the radio show&nbsp;Money Talk. Prior to Money Talk Brinker was a presenter of talk shows on WCAU (now known as WPHT) and WWBD in his hometown, Philadelphia. A highly successful marketer at the time, he went on to present his own show on WMCA based in New York in 1982. As the show grew rapidly in popularity, Brinker taught the attention of ABC and was offered his own weekend show. In 1986, Money Talk was born.</p><p>Aired on over 200 radio stations across the United States and streamed online for worldwide listeners, Brinker uses his expertise to answer the listener's questions on investment and also discusses current affairs on the program. Originally aired on Saturdays and Sundays, Money Talk can be heard only on Sundays from 4-7 (Eastern Time) from June 2010.&nbsp;Like the previous New York show, Money Talk is an instant success, as Brinker successfully solves thousands of people's investment riddles. Although his advice on market timing is questioned by other financial experts, Brinker is proven to be a trusted figure in the financial world due to his lifelong knowledge and his impressive record. In addition to the radio program, Brinker publishes a monthly investment newsletter Marketimer, which gives in depth information on market timing, specific mutual fund recommendations and Federal Reserve policy.&nbsp;With nearly thirty years in the investment business, it comes to no surprise that the investment guru has a pretty impressive track record: he was the Investment Counsel Vice-President at the Bank of New York also served as a Chief Investment Officer for the U.S division of the Guardian Royal Exchange, based in London.&nbsp;Brinker is a lifelong (and notable) member of the New York Society of Security Analysts and the Financial Analysts Federation. He is the co-founder of an Investment management company, BJ Group â€“ a division of Centurion Capital Management.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97waiZZpqinrussdFmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./producer-says-lisa-rinna-can-never-be-replaced-on-rhobh.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Producer Says Lisa Rinna Can 'Never' Be Replaced on 'RHOBH'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-has-tiffany-boone-been-up-to-since-leaving-the-show.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>What Has Tiffany Boone Been up to Since Leaving the Show?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
