In the early ’80s, the&nbsp;Chasing Amy&nbsp;actor was frustrated with constantly landing <a href=#>supporting roles</a>. He wanted more and wasn’t afraid to go for it.</p><p id=par-5_71>In 1997, Affleck and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Damon</a>&nbsp;wrote the script for&nbsp;Good Will Hunting.&nbsp;The unknown pair refused to release control of the project as their agents shopped it around to several studios. Miramax finally agreed to their terms.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Robin Williams</a>&nbsp;signed on to play the pivotal role of therapist Sean Maguire, and the rest, as they say, is history. They won the Oscar that year for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Original Screenplay</a>, and the boys from Boston were on their way.</p><p id=par-6_39>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a> Affleck went on to land leading roles in blockbuster films such as&nbsp;Armageddon, Pearl Harbor,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Daredevil.&nbsp;After working on countless successful projects, in 2012, the&nbsp;Gone Girl&nbsp;star received his second Academy Award for&nbsp;Argo,&nbsp;a political thriller that he starred in and directed.</p><p id=par-7_48>With a career spanning almost three decades in the film industry, the A-list actor has received three Golden Globe, two Screen Actors Guild, and two BAFTA Awards. Affleck has an estimated net worth of $150 million, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wealthy Gorilla</a>&nbsp;claims he is “one of the wealthiest actors in the world.”</p><h2 id=h-standing-up-to-his-love-interests>Standing up to his love interests</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/OfficialPLT/status/1405129514867384320</p></figure><p id=par-8_32>At 48 years of age, Affleck has had his share of relationships. He married&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Garner</a>&nbsp;in 2005, and the couple shares three children. They divorced in 2017 but have an amicable co-parenting relationship.</p><p id=par-9_38>The Runner&nbsp;executive producer is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">giving love another try</a>&nbsp;with pop star sensation Lopez. Standing at 6 feet and 4 inches tall, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Delite</a>, Affleck towers over his leading lady.

According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glamour</a>, the couple broke up when Affleck started dating Lopez (round one). At five feet and nine inches tall, she is one of his only girlfriends that came close to meeting his tall stature.</p><p id=par-12_39>Affleck’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">15-year-old daughter</a>&nbsp;Violet has apparently inherited her father’s genes. Hollywood Life reported, “the teen is already towering over her famous mom.” Since Garner is five feet and eight inches tall, Violet is close to five feet ten or eleven inches.</p><h2 id=h-how-height-influences-roles-in-hollywood>How height influences roles in Hollywood</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_49>Last year, Affleck bulked up to a hefty 245 pounds for his role as a former basketball player struggling with addiction in&nbsp;The Way Back.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>&nbsp;reported that he gained weight by indulging in carbs like pizza and junk food. Affleck said, “I totally indulged in a very alcoholic way with food.”</p><p id=par-14_20>Saying it was “the most satisfying performance experience” of his life, Affleck is now back to his regular 210 pounds.</p><p id=par-15_33>Actors are constantly changing their appearance for the sake of the character they are portraying. A recent study revealed that the taller a man is, the more money he makes, except in Hollywood.</p><p id=par-16_40>Some of the highest-paid actors in the industry, such as <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a> and Robert Downey, Jr., are only five feet and seven inches.
