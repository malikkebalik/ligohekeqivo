The brand launched with its best-selling Long Lasting Polish line, and today, is continuing its legacy of creating products that deliver quality at-home manicures with the brand-new <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Quick Dry Polish</a> — and spoiler alert, it definitely sparks joy.</p><p>“When we started thinking about [creating] the products, I was really specific about how they would work,” said Tuttle. Most other quick-dry polish formulas chip more quickly than traditional polish, but Olive & June claims their new formula stays on nails 45% longer than the competition. In addition, the intense color pay-off makes it possible to finish your mani in only one or two coats — making it way easier to squeeze in your at-home mani on-the-go or in-between tasks. Tuttle’s biggest goal was to create a polish that lasts, so the Quick Dry Polish is meant to last over five days.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Courtesy of Olive & June</p></figure><p>The formula of Olive & June’s Quick Dry Polish differs from the classic Long Lasting Polish due to the amount of resin in the paint, which had to be adjusted in order to create a more lightweight formula without sacrificing pigment payoff. In terms of color, the Quick Dry Polish comes in 19 shades that range from the classic black and white to a myriad of pastels and brights. Tuttle said she wanted to provide a ton of color options at a more accessible price point of just $7.50 a bottle.</p><p>“My biggest dream in the world is to have a mass consumer line,” said Tuttle. “The most important thing is that as many people as possible can afford the amazingness that is Olive & June.”</p><h2>My Review</h2><p>After trying out the Olive & June Quick Dry Polish myself, I found that it really does dry in about a minute. After painting two coats and adding a top coat, it felt like the polish dried immediately and I was able to continue my day without having to worry about it smudging. I also found that it was super long-lasting, with only a few minor chips on the edges that were an easy fix with a quick reapplication of my chosen color and the Quick Dry Top Coat. I have continued to use the polish and switch up my color every couple of weeks. If you prefer to do your own at-home manis, but don’t want the hassle of the dry time wait, the Olive & June Quick Dry Polish is truly the best polish to try.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC%2F07Kjnmefoba3sYyjrKedXabCqq%2FKZpursV2lvK210qE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ruby-lin-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ruby Lin Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./martha-stewart-on-celebrity-lifestyle-brands-i-m-proud-to-have-spearheaded-that-industry.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Martha Stewart on celebrity lifestyle brands: Im proud to have spearheaded that industry</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
