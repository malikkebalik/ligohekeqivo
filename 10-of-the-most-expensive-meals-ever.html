More and more people are keen to score a coveted table at their city's hottest restaurants. Edible creations such as the cronut inspire people to line up for hours just to get a taste of the treat. Not surprisingly, high price tags are often attached to these cult favorite foods. The following 10 dishes from 10 different restaurants truly take the cake…or beef…or what you fancy. These are some of the most expensive dishes and meals ever created. Which one of these would you want on your culinary bucket list?</p><p><strong>What: The Douche Burger</strong></p><p><strong>Where: The 666 Burger Food Truck, New York City</strong></p><p><strong>How Much: $666</strong></p><p>The Douche Burger started out as a joke. It was intended to make fun of all those burgers with way too many toppings on them. The 666 Burger food truck in New York City set out to make the burger to end all burgers by deciding to "pile all the rich people stuff on it" and the Douche Burger was born. A Kobe beef patty is stuffed with foie gras and then covered in champagne stem Gruyere cheese. The burger is then topped with truffles, lobster, caviar, and a BBQ sauce made with coffee beans––but not just any coffee beans, these are Kopi Luwak coffee beans which have been eaten, digested, and then eliminated by an Asian palm civet (also known as the toddy cat).</p><p><strong>What: Zillion Dollar Lobster Frittata</strong></p><p><strong>Where: Le Parker Meridien, New York City</strong></p><p><strong>How Much: $1,000</strong></p><p>If you're in New York City and in the mood for a fancy breakfast, look no further than the Le Parker Meridien on 56th street and their most gourmet of gourmet frittata. The Zillion Dollar Lobster Frittata is made with 10 ounces of $65 per ounce sefruga caviar, six eggs, an entire lobster, chives and cream. You can also get a less deluxe version (presumably without the $65 per ounce caviar) for $100.</p><p><strong>What: Sushi del Oriente</strong></p><p><strong>Where: Milan, Italy</strong></p><p><strong>How Much: $1,980</strong></p><p>This enterprising and expensive sushi roll comes to us from Chef Angelito Araneta, Jr. It was the featured dish as a restaurant in Milan, but it was not for sale. The sushi roll is comprised of foie gras, wild saffron, and sea cucumber. It was then topped with 12 Palawan pearls, four 0.2 karat diamonds, and wrapped in gold leaf.</p><p><strong>What: Pizza Royale 007</strong></p><p><strong>Where: Ebay</strong></p><p><strong>How Much: $4,200</strong></p><p>Chances are you're not calling Domino's for this pizza. This 12-inch one of a kind pizza was created by Chef Domenico Crolla for charity. The pizza was topped with lobster marinated in cognac, Scottish smoked salmon, sun-blush tomato sauce, prosciutto, champagne soaked caviar, medallions of venison, and vintage balsamic vinegar. It was then sprinkled with edible 24-carat gold flakes. The pizza was then put on eBay to raise money for The Fred Hollows Foundation, an Australian charity that helps millions of people keep or regain their sight. An Italian attorney named Maurizio Morelli had the winning bid of $4,200.</p><p><strong>What: AnQi Pho Soup</strong></p><p><strong>Where: Santa Monica, California</strong></p><p>How Much: $5,000</p><p>Santa Monica's Tiato Restaurant is the home of the $5,000 Pho. It is made with Wagyu beef, noodles made from the meat of a rare blue lobster, foie gras broth, and white Alba truffles. If you want to sample this pho, be sure to make a reservation at least a week in advance and let the restaurant know this is what you'll be ordering as the restaurant needs seven days just to prepare it. The soup was created in 2011 and auctioned off at the Bash Benefactor Dinner on May 13, 2011. The money raised went to the Children's Hospitals of Los Angeles and Orange County as well as to the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital. Mom always said a bowl of soup was good for our health!</p><p><strong>What: Pink Bike Burger</strong></p><p><strong>Where:</strong> <strong>Galleries Lafayette, Dubai Mall</strong></p><p><strong>How Much: $7,000</strong></p><p>The Pink Bike burger was another meal created to raise money for a good cause. It was the idea of the Pink Caravan at Galleries Lafayette in Dubai Mall. It obliterated the record for the most expensive burger ever sold at $7,000. This burger wasn't even topped with crazy expensive toppings. The auction was set up as a competition between teams made up of members of the Pink Caravan whose mission is to increase breast cancer awareness in the UAE.</p><p><strong>What: Fortress Stilt Fisherman Indulgence</strong></p><p><strong>Where:</strong> Fortress Resort & Spa, Sri Lanka</p><p><strong>How Much: $14,500</strong></p><p>DUO restaurant at the Fortress Resort and Spa in Sri Lanka bills this dessert a "first class delicacy perfect for those who crave the thrill and satisfaction that an ordinary dessert simply cannot deliver" on their menu. The gold leaf Italian cassata with mango and pomegranate compote and Irish cream infused dried fruit is topped with Dom Perignon champagne sabayon. To finish the dessert off, a handmade chocolate carving of a fisherman holding onto his stilts accompanies it. The dessert is served in a dish adorned with an 80 karat Aquamarine stone.</p><p><strong>What: The Frrrozen Haute Chocolate Ice Cream</strong></p><p><strong>Where:</strong> <strong>Serendipity 3, New York City</strong></p><p><strong>How Much: $25,000</strong></p><p>This frozen hot chocolate was at one time the Guinness World Record holder for the most expensive dessert. It was created by Serendipity 3 in partnership with jeweler Euphoria New York. Made with 28 different cocoas, 14 of which are the world's most exotic and expensive. The dessert's ice cream is infused with five grams of 23-karat gold and it is served in a goblet lined with edible gold. Fastened around the goblet is an 18-karat gold bracelet decorated with 1-carat white diamonds. As if that wasn't enough, the dish is topped with gold covered whipped cream and a $2,600 a pound La Madeline au Truffle from Knipschildt Chocolatier. The dessert is eaten with a gold spoon decorated with white and chocolate colored diamonds.</p><p><strong>What: Pudding</strong></p><p><strong>Where:</strong> <strong>Lindeth Howe Country House Hotel, England</strong></p><p><strong>How Much: $34,531</strong></p><p>Lindeth Howe Country House Hotel was once owned by beloved children's author <a href=# title="Beatrix Potter Net Worth">Beatrix Potter</a> created a chocolate pudding that costs $34,531. The dessert by Chef Marc Guibert is designed to resemble a Faberge egg and adorned in gold leaf, champagne, caviar, and a 2-carat diamond. If you feel like dropping nearly $35 grand on dessert, be sure to order it well in advance. This pudding takes two weeks to make!</p><p><strong>What: Strawberries Arnaud</strong></p><p><strong>Where:</strong> <strong>Arnaud's Restaurant, New Orleans, Louisiana</strong></p><p><strong>How Much: $3.95 million</strong></p><p>Arnaud's co-owner Katy Casbarian created an over the top proposal package. The Strawberries Arnaud is strawberries served in a marinade of spices, red wine, port, and citrus with vanilla ice cream. Now that sounds delicious but certainly not worth $3.95 million. The dessert comes with a 7.09 karat pink diamond. After all, this is a proposal package.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJoaGlln5t6tbTEZqSoq6Risrm8xKeqoq6VYrqmrcusZJ6ulad8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./boston-scott-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Boston Scott Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-lara-spencer-the-gma-anchor-s-injury-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What happened to Lara Spencer?
