Fenn had previously appeared in&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gilmore Girls</a>. While fans of the shows argue there are many similarities between the two sitcoms, Fenn’s appearance in the shows is especially interesting. Fenn played unlikeable characters in both.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;and&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;really similar shows?</h2><p id=par-2_36>Upon first glance,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Friends</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;might not seem similar. After all,&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;is all about family relationships, while&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;focuses on a group of pals trying to figure out life in Manhattan. The two shows, however, do have some interesting similarities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sherilyn-Fenn.jpg><p id=par-3_41>Both&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;and&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;relied on witty banter to propel their storyline forward. Both shows had characters with the last name&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Geller</a>, and the main characters on both series enjoyed a fair bit of coffee.&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;also utilized a contested cheating storyline, just as&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;did years before.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sherilyn Fenn played one of Chandler’s love interests in&nbsp;Friends</h2><p id=par-4_47>Aside from actual similarities in the show,&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;and&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;shared a few guest actors. Fenn is, perhaps, the easiest to spot. Her role in&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;took place years before she would become Anna Nardini. In the season 3 episode, “The One With Pheobe’s Ex-Partner,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chandler Bing</a>&nbsp;meets Ginger, portrayed by Fenn, in&nbsp;Central Perk.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_72>There is one big problem, though. Joey had previously dated Ginger and stopped returning her calls when he accidentally threw her prosthetic leg in a fireplace. Ginger and Chandler’s relationship ultimately doesn’t work out because Ginger is grossed out by Chandler’s third nipple, which he calls a nubbin. Fans of the show largely hate how quickly Ginger rejected Chandler. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, she only ever appeared in one episode of the famed show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sherilyn Fenn showed up in&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;and thwarted Luke and Lorelai’s relationship</h2><p id=par-6_67>Several years after running out of Chandler’s apartment over a nubbin, Fenn showed up on&nbsp;Gilmore Girls. In fact, the actor took on two different roles on the show. First, she portrayed Sasha, the girlfriend of Jess Mariano’s biological father. The episode, which was supposed to serve as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a backdoor pilot</a>, is pretty forgettable. Later, she appeared on the series in a much more memorable but altogether unlikable part.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_92>In season 6, Fenn appeared in&nbsp;Gilmore Girls&nbsp;as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anna Nardini</a>, the mother of Luke Danes’ long-lost daughter, April. As the backstory goes, Luke and Anna had dated but broke up just before she discovered that she was pregnant. Anna claimed that she didn’t bother to tell him about the pregnancy because of Luke’s disdain for children. Fans largely hate Anna because she is considered the cause of Luke and Lorelai’s second breakup. She was pretty pushy, demanding, and a little illogical, but in the end, Luke and Lorelai’s romance ended because of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Luke’s commitment issues</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAqbHRoqOypl2bsq%2B6jLCYrGWRo3q2usuiop6ZkqGybq%2FHmqmam6Sav267zWaZqKyYYrOztcSnm6xlkaOxbrPIpaSoqpVitKq%2By6xloaydoXw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./was-tanner-courtad-comparing-rachel-recchia-to-gabby-windey-going-too-far-the-bachelor-in-paradi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Was Tanner Courtad comparing Rachel Recchia to Gabby Windey going too far?
