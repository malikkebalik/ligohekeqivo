Lead singer Alex Turner, drummer Matt Helders, guitarist Jamie Cook and bassist Nick O’Malley make up the ensemble. There is confusion among their fans about whether the band has broken up or not. In this post, you will know the truth.</p><h2>Is the News of Arctic Monkeys’ Breakup True?</h2><p><strong>They went on a break in 2018 after the release of their sixth album “<a href=# rel=noopener>Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino</a>” although they haven’t broken up.</strong></p><p>In 2022, they released a song “<a href=# rel=noopener>There’d Better Be A Mirrorball</a>” which is about a breakup, but it is not about their own breakup. <strong>The band is still together.</strong> In October 2023, the band returned to “Dublin & Belfast” for a series of arena dates to mark the end of their World Tour.</p><p><strong>You can also check out our below posts related to other bands:</strong></p><h2><strong>When Was “Arctic Monkeys” Rock-Band Form?</strong></h2><p><strong>The well-known English rock group Arctic Monkeys has been producing music since 2002.&nbsp;</strong>As one of the first bands to gain widespread recognition on the Internet, Arctic Monkeys were hailed by observers as a potential shift in the way that up-and-coming acts are pushed and sold.</p><p>Upon its release, their debut album “Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not” was met with critical praise and went on to become the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history. It also peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart.</p><p>It has been praised as one of the best debut albums ever after winning Best British Album at the 2007 Brit Awards. Favorite Worst Nightmare, the band’s second album was likewise well-received by critics and took home the Best British Album trophy at the 2008 Brit Awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Arctic-Monkeys.jpg><p>After that, they put out two more albums, Humbug and Suck It and See, both of which earned positive reviews from critics although not as much as their first two. The band achieved widespread international recognition following the release of their highly regarded fifth album, “AM” which was bolstered by the worldwide hit song “Do I Wanna Know?”</p><p>In the US, it received three platinum certifications and peaked on four Billboard charts. The album became their third to win British Album of the Year at the 2014 Brit Awards. The band’s 2018 sixth album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, marked a significant shift from their earlier guitar-heavy material to a more piano-focused record.</p><p>It was their second nomination for Best Alternative Music Album at the 2019 Grammy Awards, following Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not. Their seventh album, “The Car”, came out in 2022 and was nominated for a 2023 Mercury Prize as well as an Ivor Novello Award.</p><h2>Which Member Left <strong>“Arctic Monkeys”?</strong></h2><p><strong>Andy Nicholson, the band’s former bassist left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released. </strong>Along with Jon McClure of Reverend and The Makers, he established Mongrel in 2008. He joined the band The Book Club, which was fronted by former Miller Joe Carnall, in 2009 as their bassist.</p><p>However, he departed the group later that year to play with Reverend and The Makers. He presently produces and performs with Maticmouth from Reverend Soundsystem in the hip-hop ensemble Clubs & Spades.</p><p>Nicholson, an alumni of Stocksbridge High School was the lone Arctic Monkey who did not reside in the High Green district, instead choosing to live in the neighboring town of Hillsborough.</p><p>You can <a href=# rel=noopener>follow our Twitter account</a> for more related to these kinds of topics.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdhZnxxfo6aqZysmZh6rrvNpJyyq12Xv6atyq6naA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fox-news-calls-andrea-tantaros-an-opportunist.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fox News Calls Andrea Tantaros an 'Opportunist'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-brooks-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Brooks Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
