His father, José, was in prison for three years as a political prisoner during the Communist Cuban government.

Secada primarily spent the rest of his childhood in Hialeah, Florida. He attended Hialeah Senior High School and performed in musical theater. During a performance of "A Christmas Carol" in 11th grade, he realized he had strong musical talent and decided to pursue a career in music, after being encouraged by his parents.</p><p>After high school, he attended the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami. There, he received a Bachelor of Music in 1983 and then a Master of Music in jazz vocal performance in 1986.
