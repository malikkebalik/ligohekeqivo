Anthony Anderson reprised his character of Detective Kevin Bernard in that season. However, now the 52-year-old actor will not be part of the upcoming season of the series.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Read out the full article to know about the reason behind not returning for Law & Order Season 22.</span></p><h2><b>Reason for Anthony Anderson leaving Law & Order</b></h2><p><span>Anthony Anderson, who gained popularity with his amazing performance on television shows and films like Black-ish and Me Myself and Irene (starring <a href=# rel=noopener>Jim Carrey</a>) has now taken an exit from the show as he had signed a one-year contract only.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Reason-for-Anthony-Anderson-leaving-Law-Order.jpg><p><span>Anderson just has a deal for one year with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NBC</a> when he returns to reprise his character in 2021, but as the agreement has now ended, he won’t be returning for any further seasons now.</span></p><p><span>In spite of being a part of the show for a short period of time, he opened up about his departure. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, he said “I wanted to go off and create more shows like Black-ish, create things that I have ownership in, and do something a little bit different,” adding “We’re going out and pitching another drama called Miraculous, which I’m excited about, so looking forward to what that’s going to do.”</span></p><h2><b>How will Anthony Anderson’s character be written out of Law & Order?</b></h2><p><span>So now when he is not returning for the new season, his return to the show cannot be expected anytime soon. But we may expect the writers to reprise his character following almost a decade.</span></p><p><span>Anthony’s character will be written off as Rick Eid, the showrunner revealed in an interview with TV Line that his departure would be managed in a usual way. He said “It’s a little mention. It’s in the time-honored tradition of <a href=# rel=noopener>Law & Order</a> where it’s very brief and it’s like, ‘Moving on. Here we go. We’ve got to solve the case.'”</span></p><p><b>Final Words</b></p><p><span>Well Anthony’s character will surely be missed by his fans.
