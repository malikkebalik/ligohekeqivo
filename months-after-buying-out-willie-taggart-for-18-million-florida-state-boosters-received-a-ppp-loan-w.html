But as we've continued to see, organizations that bring in a lot of money are also receiving funds. One of those organizations? Florida State.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The United States Small Business Administration released a database with 82,708 small businesses or nonprofit organizations that have received at least a million dollars in funding from the PPP. And Seminole Boosters, Inc., the booster club of Florida State, </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>was on that list</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>. They're not the only sports team to receive financial aid, either. The Los Angeles Lakers got a $4.6 million loan, and their franchise is worth about $3.7 billion.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Seminole Boosters actually received $1,017,455, but after reviewing terms of the loan they returned $130,430, keeping a total of $887,725. The school said the loan, which was awarded in mid-April, would allow 54 people to keep their jobs through June 30.&nbsp;</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-303785 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1180668181.jpg alt width=900 height=627 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-303785 class=wp-caption-text>Streeter Lecka/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, the school </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>recently announced</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> it was cutting several positions within the athletic department and Seminole Boosters. The move comes amid growing uncertainty that the 2020 college football season will start on time. College football is a big revenue draw at most universities, and Florida State is certainly no exception.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Adding to the complexity is Florida State's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">buyout agreement with Willie Taggart</a>. The university fired its former head coach in November of 2019. Under Taggart, Florida State had a 9-12 record and missed a bowl game for the first time in 36 seasons.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The university paid $18 million to Taggart to get rid of him. Throw in buyout packages for his assistants and the total rises to $22 million. That payment looked bad at the time. It looks even worse now, with the university laying off multiple people – even after receiving a hefty loan.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Hopefully, schools can eventually bounce back from their financial losses. Until then, it's looking like lean times ahead.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjqamp6yYqHqistOeqWaapa62r7OMqKytZaeeua21xGarmp%2BXlr%2B1ecWoqWZpaGK6qrjLoqanZZahvLO1w5pkrKyRqbJurs6oqq2doqh6s7HCnqCvnZRirm68z6lkpaeRo3q4u9Gtn2ZxYGV9cXyO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./simon-pegg-assures-us-that-khan-is-not-the-villain-in-star-trek-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Simon Pegg Assures Us That Khan Is NOT The Villain In Star Trek 2</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./luiz-felipe-scolari-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Luiz Felipe Scolari Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
