While the country star and the No Doubt frontwoman seem like the perfect fit, <a href=#>divorce rumors plagued them</a> throughout their marriage. Shelton and Stefani discussed their “insecurities” in April 2024. Here’s what Shelton said about how he and Stefani are insecure in all the same ways.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-discussed-the-insecurities-they-have-in-their-marriage>Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani discussed the ‘insecurities’ they have in their marriage</h2><p id=par-2_55>Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani seem like an unlikely couple. However, they connected over their grief after spending time together on NBC’s The Voice. Stefani was going through a <a href=#>divorce with Gavin Rossdale</a> when Shelton was divorcing Miranda Lambert. Stefani and Shelton leaned on each other through their difficulties and found love in one another.</p><p id=par-3_36>In April 2024, Shelton and Stefani discussed their relationship with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nylon Magazine</a>. Stefani verified that she and Shelton are in a great place with their marriage. However, they still get insecure regarding what the future holds.</p><p id=par-4_65>“I had been going through those times where you’re questioning: ‘Oh my gosh, am I just getting older? Am I cute?’” Stefani admitted. “In my own relationship, even though I know the truth of what’s happening today, you still create drama in your own mind about your insecurities and what might happen. I was in that phase of the relationship with Blake and getting paranoid.”</p><p id=par-5_46>Shelton reflected on how he’s also scared of the future. “It’s an insecurity we both have,” he added. “These are conversations that she and I have with each other: ‘Are you still going to love me when I’m old or if I forget who I am?’”</p><p id=par-6_19>Stefani added that while she occasionally overthinks her relationship, she knows she’s “in love” with her best friend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-country-star-said-he-s-weird-about-who-he-writes-music-with>The country star said he’s ‘weird’ about who he writes music with</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Gwen-Stefani-Blake-Shelton-3.jpg><p id=par-7_69>Gwen Stefani didn’t grow up listening to country music. However, since marrying Blake Shelton, she’s dabbled in the genre. She and Shelton put out their country single, “Purple Irises,” in 2024 — and fans love hearing the duo sing together on a track. While the song sounds like one that Shelton might write, Stefani wrote it as a solo before inviting her husband to sing on it with her.</p><p id=par-8_57>Shelton once told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> that he feels “insecure” about his songwriting and can get “weird” about who he writes songs with. “I’m insecure about my writing and who I write with, and I don’t know – I’m just weird about it sometimes,” he said in 2016. However, he feels comfortable creating with Stefani despite their different backgrounds.</p><p id=par-9_49>“As different as we are musically, we’re a fan of the same type of songs,” Shelton continued. “We have these playlists that we send each other that are stuff that we loved growing up and they’re so similar, so I think it made it easy for us to collaborate.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-blake-shelton-calls-his-relationship-with-gwen-stefani-natural-and-normal>Blake Shelton calls his relationship with Gwen Stefani ‘natural and normal’</h2><p id=par-10_42>Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani never expected to fall in love with each other. While Stefani’s from California, she loves <a href=#>Oklahoma life on the ranch</a>. Their slice of country heaven allows them to get away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood.</p><p id=par-11_31>“We get away from everything [in L.A.], and we’re just&nbsp;us. It truly does feel different,” Shelton explained to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> in 2022. “That’s where I feel the most comfortable, happy and safe.”</p><p id=par-12_9>Shelton added that his marriage to Stefani feels “natural.”</p><p id=par-13_37>“The relationship that we have is so natural and so normal,” he continued. “This feels like the easiest thing I’ve ever been a part of. To me,&nbsp;she’s my best friend&nbsp;and everything that I need and lean on.”</p><p id=par-14_15>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, subscribe to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s YouTube channel</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6orfErGSbpJGgsm6%2Fx56jraeeYrS4sc1mqq2dlpa7qnnFnpylZZmjwKav1KucZqWRp7%2BqrcaeZaGsnaF8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-mark-wahlberg-s-wife-hated-about-his-method-acting.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Mark Wahlbergs Wife Hated About His Method Acting</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jon-secada-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jon Secada Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
