The band's first studio album in a decade, Happiness Begins, is packed with danceable tunes, references to their history, and love songs dedicated to their wives. In fact, the most <a href=# class=T3D>romantic lyrics the Jonas Brothers wrote on Happiness Begins</a> will make you even more jealous of <a href=# class=T3D>the fact that you're not a "JSister" </a>than ever before.</p><p>"It's very important on an album for us to have some romantic songs," Kevin told Apple Music when Happiness Begins was released on June 7, and it seems as if the trio have more than lived up to that promise. In addition to the song "Comeback" — which plays double duty as a plea to an ex and an homage to the brother's reunion — and <a href=# class=T3D>the "Lovebug"-esque acoustic ballad "Love Her,"</a> both Nick and Joe also wrote "love letters" to their significant others that have fans swooning. In April, Nick told Billboard that <a href=# class=T3D>"I Believe" was inspired by his whirlwind romance</a> with wife Priyanka Chopra, while "Hesitate" was <a href=# class=T3D>Joe's ode to his relationship with Sophie Turner</a>.</p><p>While many years have passed since the band's heyday as Disney Channel superstars, listening to some of the more romantic songs on Happiness Begins is guaranteed to bring back your overwhelming crush on the Jonas Brothers once more. Don't say we didn't warn you.</p><h2>"Call me crazy and people saying that we move too fast / But I've been waiting, and for a reason / Ain’t no turning back / 'Cause you show me something I can't live without" — "I Believe"</h2><p>Nick's "love letter" to Chopra <a href=# class=T3D>takes on anyone who criticized the pair's decision</a> to tie the knot less than a year after their first date, and proves that <a href=# class=T3D>their romance is definitely one for the ages</a>.</p><h2>"No matter the fight you know she's always right / And it's alright / And they say love can hurt / But seein’ her smile can get you every time" — "Love Her"</h2><p>"Love Bug" is an important song for the Jonas Brothers — in fact, <a href=# class=T3D>playing that song together inspired the boys to reunite</a> — so it seems only fitting that their comeback album has a song take takes that romantic, incredibly catchy sentiment to the next level.</p><h2>"I thank the oceans for giving me you / You saved me once and now I'll save you too / I won't hesitate for you" — "Hesitate"</h2><p>Joe confirmed that <a href=# class=T3D>"Hesitate" is his ode to new wife Turner</a>, telling Apple Music that the song is "one of those love letters you write to your partner saying, 'I'll be there no matter what.'" Just when you thought these two couldn't be more romantic.</p><h2>"I'm a sucker for you / You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly" — "Sucker"</h2><p></p><p>In addition to being a catchy, smash hit comeback single, "Sucker" is also a song all about how devoted the Jonas Brothers are to their wives. And after watching the "JSisters" steal the show in the music video, fans totally get it.</p><h2>"Every night, every day; how about every lifetime? / Yeah, I know what they say, and that's fine / 'Cause I'm here to stay through the good and the bad times" — "I Believe"</h2><p>Promising to love your wife through "every lifetime" is perfectly on brand for Nick, considering he practically <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>proposed to Chopra on their first date</a>.</p><h2>"Time stands still and it's only us / What we feel started way before we ever touched / Just imagine only us / Yeah, you found me right before I'd given up" — "Strangers"</h2><p>In addition to being the most reminiscent of their power-pop peak, "Strangers" also has the kind of "love at first sight, somehow it feels like I've known you forever" story that we always imagined as part of our own daydreams about falling in love with the Jonas Brothers.</p><h2>"Come back to me, baby, I'll come back to you / You know the place that I go runnin’ to" — "Comeback"</h2><p>Yes, "Comeback" is technically about Nick, Kevin, and Joe coming back together to make music again, but it can also be seen as a deeply romantic song about people coming back together after struggling while apart. Either way, it's guaranteed to make Jonas Brothers fans a little misty-eyed when they listen to it.</p><p>The Jonas Brothers have certainly grown and changed a great deal in the years since releasing their last studio album, but at least longtime JoBro fans can count on the fact that these three will always be able to write a deeply romantic love song.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jq2fnmWdpMC1edGopJqmpJ6wbrTAqaeippWowG6uxKCgp6tdocaztcKsZLChnKF6rq3KnmSyp6VisLPB0qFkqKZdqbWmecmopZqrXZe%2FsMDHnqmsZZGhuW671Z6pZpmXlraveZBwcHFuaW59</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-are-their-real-ages.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Are Their Real Ages?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./squid-game-the-challenge-did-no-302-leann-actually-want-to-beat-her-son-no-301-trey.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Squid Game: The Challenge: Did No. 302 LeAnn actually want to beat her son, No. 301 Trey?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
