As a renowned psychologist and author, Grant has significantly contributed to organizational psychology with his fresh insights and evidence-based approaches.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>His humor and perspectives are both razor-sharp, so reading his works is never a bore. He doesn’t merely spoon-feed information; instead, he piques interest, making readers his eager allies in challenging conventional wisdom. This list of five of his books is in no particular order, but each contains clever quips and actionable <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wisdom that keeps readers coming back for more</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-give-and-take-why-helping-others-drives-our-success-2013 data-injectable=false>Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success&nbsp;(2013)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Give-and-Take-Why-Helping-Others-Drives-Our-Success-2013.jpg><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>Adam Grant’s&nbsp;Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success&nbsp;is a book that turns the dog-eat-dog world of success literature on its well-groomed head. Grant, acting as both scholar and literary chef, mixes a pinch of psychology with a generous dollop of social science to challenge the notion that the only way to climb the corporate ladder is by stepping on fingers.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=902 data-injectable=true>With the deftness of a master storyteller, he introduces us to the “givers,” those rare birds in the corporate aviary who actually prefer to prop others up the rungs rather than hoarding all the glory. Grant’s narrative acknowledges the cutthroat reality of the business world while also providing a compelling case for the strategic benefits of altruism. He doesn’t just urge us to play nice; he shows us that this kindness can be the sling in our professional David-versus-Goliath battles.</p><h2 id=h-originals-how-non-conformists-move-the-world-2016 data-injectable=false>Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World&nbsp;(2016)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Originals-How-Non-Conformists-Move-the-World-2016.jpg><p data-characters=430 data-current-count=730 data-injectable=true>In&nbsp;Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World, Adam Grant takes us on a scholarly tour through the wildflower fields of nonconformity, where the bees buzz with unconventional ideas. With the grace of an academic acrobat, he flips over the staid assumptions of creativity and lands squarely on the notion that the movers and shakers of the world are those who doodle in the margins rather than color within the lines.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=578 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>This book is not a mere tribute to the eccentric and the maverick; instead, it’s a well-footnoted guide to thinking differently. Grant plays the role of a myth-buster with aplomb, taking a sledgehammer to the old statue that innovation is the sole province of born geniuses and serendipitous eureka moments. Instead, he presents a narrative that’s more “workshop” than “lightbulb,” where sweat is just as important as inspiration.&nbsp;Originals&nbsp;doesn’t just celebrate the road less traveled, but also offers a roadmap for those brave enough to take it.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-think-again-the-power-of-knowing-what-you-don-t-know-2021 data-injectable=false>Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know&nbsp;(2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Think-Again-The-Power-of-Knowing-What-You-Dont-Know-2021.jpg><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>Adam Grant goes on a mental safari in&nbsp;Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know,&nbsp;searching for the elusive beast of intellectual humility. Grant guides us through the thorny wilderness of our own convictions, challenging us to reevaluate the ease with which we’ve arranged the furnishings in our heads.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>What readers find most endearing is that Grant doesn’t preach from an ivory tower of infallibility; instead, he’s the genial host mixing with the guests, questioning his own beliefs as freely as he questions others’. The book is a testament to the power of thinking like a scientist, where one’s most cherished theories are always one experiment away from a revolution.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-option-b-facing-adversity-building-resilience-and-finding-meaning-2016 data-injectable=false>Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Meaning&nbsp;(2016)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Option-B-Facing-Adversity-Building-Resilience-and-Finding-Meaning-2016.jpg><p data-characters=414 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy, co-authored by Adam Grant and Sheryl Sandberg, serves as a literary life raft in the choppy seas of misfortune. This book navigates the rough waters of grieving with an honesty that is as refreshing as it is uplifting, using Sandberg’s personal journey through loss as the compass and Grant’s psychological expertise as the sails.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>The book recognizes the dragons of despair while arming readers with swords of resilience, making it less of a manual on “getting over” tragedy and more of a blueprint to “getting through” it. Moreover, the subtle humor serves not to trivialize pain but to make it more bearable, to whisper that in the arena of adversity, sometimes the chorus can afford a chuckle.</p><h2 id=h-hidden-potential-the-science-of-achieving-greater-things-2023 data-injectable=false>Hidden Potential: The Science of Achieving Greater Things&nbsp;(2023)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hidden-Potential-by-Adam-Grant.jpg><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Hidden Potential: The Science of Achieving Greater Things&nbsp;is a book that will make you rethink everything you know about success. It’s not about being born with the right genes or having a privileged upbringing. It’s about developing the character skills and motivational structures to help you reach your full potential.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=542 data-current-count=886 data-injectable=false>In his usual witty and engaging style, Grant shares groundbreaking evidence and surprising insights from business, sports, education, and beyond. He shows us that anyone can achieve great things, regardless of their starting point. One of the key takeaways from the book is that growth is not about innate genius. It’s about grit, perseverance, and a willingness to learn. Grant introduces us to “deliberate practice,” which involves setting specific goals, getting feedback, and pushing ourselves outside our comfort zones.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeSpLysv46tn55lZWKvpr%2FTZpidmZ1itLOtza1km6efoMBw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./was-lawmen-bass-reeves-esau-pierce-a-real-person.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Was Lawmen: Bass Reeves Esau Pierce a real person?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lyn-lear-net-worth-how-rich-is-norman-lear-s-wife.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lyn Lear Net Worth: How Rich Is Norman Lears Wife?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
