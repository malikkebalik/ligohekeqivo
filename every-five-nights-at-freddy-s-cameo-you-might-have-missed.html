Brought to life by Scott Cawthon, it first gained popularity when major YouTubers started streaming their gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>Without their promotion, there’s no way the franchise would be what it is today. For that reason, it’s no surprise that a handful earned a cameo role in the movie.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-five-nights-at-freddy-s-employee-of-the-month-board data-injectable=false>Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;Employee of the Month board</h2><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>When the&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;trailer was released, many fans noticed an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Employee of the Month board</a>&nbsp;hanging in the background. After some digging, it was revealed that the photos on the board featured YouTubers 8-Bit Ryan, Baz, Razzbowski, FusionZGamer, and Dawko.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Dawko_FNAF_movie_set.jpg><h2 id=h-coryxkenshin-plays-a-cab-driver data-injectable=false>CoryxKenshin plays a cab driver</h2><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=666 data-injectable=true>Cory, better known as CoryxKenshin, is one of the top YouTubers in the country. While he’s usually creating humorous horror gaming videos, he has recently taken up <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">acting with a cameo in&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy’s.</a>&nbsp;He kept his appearance in the movie hush-hush until the trailer was released, after which he jokingly told his fans on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>:</p><p>“Yes, you guys. I am entering into my actor era. You can start calling me CoryxHollywood.”</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>In the film, Cory plays a cab driver who gives a ride to Abby, played by Piper Rubio, and a battered Freddy animatronic.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true></figure><h2 id=h-matpat-makes-a-surprise-cameo data-injectable=false>MatPat makes a surprise cameo</h2><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>Matthew Patrick, best known as MatPat, managed to keep his&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;cameo somewhat of a surprise.&nbsp;The Game Theory&nbsp;creator <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appears in the movie as a cafe waiter</a>, during which he makes a cheeky comment reminiscent of his show’s catchphrase.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true>When one of his customers turns down ordering food, he insists, claiming lunch is the most important meal of the day.

Despite being one of the biggest to give&nbsp;Five Nights at Freddy’s&nbsp;a boost by regularly streaming his gameplay and his ambiguity regarding the subject, viewers won’t find his adorable mug anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=158 data-current-count=158 data-injectable=false>During a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recent stream</a>, he shared the disappointing news, explaining that he was invited to make a cameo, but couldn’t make it work with his schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was supposed to happen.
