The show has even passed The Sopranos to become the most popular HBO series of all time. Game of Thrones also has the highest IMDB rating of any TV show ever, with 9.5/10 (it's actually tied with Breaking Bad). More than seven million people tune in each week. As you probably know, the series has a lot of characters, over 20 of whom&nbsp;have already been killed off. So far. But how much do the actors who play these characters make???</p><p>As of this year, the Game of Thrones cast has been divided into tiers according to&nbsp;how much they make per episode. The five A tier actors are now making about <strong>$300,000</strong> per episode, which is exactly twice as much as they made in previous years. Here is a bit more about the actors in the A tier:</p><p><strong>Tier A:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Peter Dinklage</a> as Tyrion Lannister: Dinklage started out in an uncredited voice role on an episode of Seinfeld back in 1995 and caught his big break starring in the 2003 film The Station Agent. Peter Dinklage has a net worth of $10 million.</p><p><a href=#>Nikolaj Coster-Waldau</a> as Jaime Lannister: Aside from Game of Thrones, Coster-Waldau's best known role is perhaps starring in the 2001 movie Black Hawk Down. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau has a net worth of $6 million.</p><p><a href=#>Lena Headey</a> as Cersei Lannister: Headey starred as <a href=# title="Sarah Connor Net Worth">Sarah Connor</a> in the TV series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. She has also starred as Gorgo, Queen of Sparta in the 300 film franchise. Lena Headey has a net worth of $2.5 million.</p><p><a href=#>Emilia Clarke</a> as Daenerys Targaryen: Clarke debuted on Broadway in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 2013. She will star as Sarah Connor in the 2015 movie Terminator Genisys. Emilia Clarke has a net worth of $3 million.</p><p><a href=# title="Kit Harington Net Worth">Kit Harington</a> as Jon Snow: Game of Thrones is Harington's first major screen role as he was a stage actor before that. He won a Young Hollywood Award for Actor of the Year in 2013. Kit Harington has a net worth of $4 million.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-243329 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GettyImages-164116939.jpg alt width=900 height=604 sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-243329 class=wp-caption-text>Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Image</p><p><strong>Tier B</strong>:</p><p>The exact per-episode salary of the Tier B actors is not known, but it inside sources speculate it's approximately $150,000 (the same amount Tier A made in previous years).&nbsp;Actors in Tier B include&nbsp;<a href=# title="Maisie Williams Net Worth">Maisie Williams</a> as Arya Stark (net worth of $3 million), <a href=# title="Sophie Turner Net Worth">Sophie Turner</a> as Sansa Stark (net worth of $3 million), <a href=# title="Natalie Dormer Net Worth">Natalie Dormer</a> as Margaery Tyrell (net worth of $3 million), and <a href=# title="Iain Glen Net Worth">Iain Glen</a> as Jorah Mormont (net worth of $3 million).</p><p>Considering just how insanely popular Game of Thrones has become around the world, you can likely expect salaries&nbsp;in both tiers&nbsp;to increase dramatically in the coming years. The actors really just need to be nice to series creator <a href=#>George R. R. Martin</a>. If he kills them off, there go the big bucks!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJon6ivXaLCpLSMnaaeq12ptaZ5wpqqrWWfm3qorcyeZKieXam1s7vNnqpmpZGgsnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-ripa-mark-s-daughter-opens-their-bedroom-door-without-knocking.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kelly Ripa &amp;amp; Marks daughter opens their bedroom door without knocking</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-anxiety-causes-disorientation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Anxiety Causes Disorientation</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
