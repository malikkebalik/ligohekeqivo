Not only can families switch to T-Mobile and save up to 20% each month with three or more lines on qualifying plans, they have peace of mind their price won’t go up with T-Mobile’s Price Lock. When those facing price hikes switch to Magenta MAX at the Un-Carrier, they’ll receive $200 per line via virtual prepaid card and up to $1,000 with five lines.”</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=false>“Inflation shouldn’t be an excuse to jack up prices just because you can get away with it. But that’s The Carriers’ way,” explained T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert. “T-Mobile is here to help our customers battle inflation by not adding to the stress of price hikes. It’s got to be a mind-numbing experience for AT&T and Verizon customers who have watched their rates go up continuously over the last few years.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmmpWjeqOt0aecrGWknbJurcKtpqtloKGuurXNoGSaZZOhrrS%2FjJqaraGfo3qtrdaynKtlmaN6tbTEZqWer12peq67waKjnmWTpLqusdGcoJqkXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./amanda-bynes-net-worth-career-lifestyle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Amanda Bynes Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-michael-bivins-net-worth-wife-children-parents.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Michael Bivins net worth?
