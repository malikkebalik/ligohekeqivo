The pop star was set to appear in the blockbuster movie The Matrix: Reloaded.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-aaliyah-best-known-for>What is Aaliyah best known for?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Aaliyah-white.jpg><p id=par-3_75>For music fans, Aaliyah is one of the all-time great talents. The young singer first burst onto the scene when she was 10 years old, singing alongside Gladys Knight in the TV show Star Search. When she was just 12 years old, Aaliyah landed a record deal, releasing her debut album in 1994. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>, the album, Age Ain’t Nothing but a Number, was a huge hit – skyrocketing young Aaliyah to worldwide fame.</p><p id=par-4_88>Although her alleged involvement with her mentor, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">R. Kelly</a>, caused some controversy to swirl around Aaliyah, that didn’t stop the young star from pursuing her dreams. In 1995, she released her second album, One in a Million, which also became a huge hit. In 2000, Aaliyah made her big-screen debut, acting in the movie Romeo Must Die. Showing a natural acting talent, the star went on to act in the movie Queen of the Damned – a film that introduced her to a whole new audience of fans.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-aaliyah-was-set-to-appear-in-the-blockbuster-movie-the-matrix-reloaded>Aaliyah was set to appear in the blockbuster movie ‘The Matrix Reloaded’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_98>Even as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaliyah</a> worked on new music, she was thinking ahead to her movie career. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BuzzFeed</a>, in early 2001, Aaliyah had been cast as Link’s wife, Zee, in the blockbuster action film The Matrix Reloaded. The young star was set to have her character introduced in The Matrix Reloaded, and in the third film in the franchise, The Matrix Revolutions, she would have a much more prominent role. However, when Aaliyah died in a plane crash in the Bahamas in August 2001, at the age of only 22, producers of the movie were forced to scramble.</p><p id=par-6_61>BuzzFeed reports that while Aaliyah had filmed her scenes for The Matrix Reloaded, she had not yet filmed scenes for the follow-up movie – The Matrix Revolutions, in which she was also set to appear. The directors, Lilly and Lana Wachowski, decided to cast Nona Gaye, the daughter of the late soul music legend Marvin Gaye, in the role of Zee.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-was-recast-in-aaliyah-s-matrix-role-after-her-untimely-death>Who was recast in Aaliyah’s ‘Matrix’ role after her untimely death?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-7_75><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> reports that at the time that she was cast as Zee, Nona Gaye only had one film to her credit – in the Will Smith-helmed biographical drama Ali. Still, Gaye was able to pick up where Aaliyah left off, reshooting her scenes and making the character her own. Still, the world mourned the loss of Aaliyah, a talent who was only able to shine for a few short years before her tragic death.</p><p id=par-8_80>These days, many still have questions about the manner of Aaliyah’s death, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some biographers claiming</a> that the published facts of her death in the plane crash still don’t make sense, and in fact, could be viewed as a “mystery.” While cinema fans may never know how Aaliyah would have managed to bring the character of Zee to life, there’s no doubt that during her brief time in Hollywood, she proved herself as one of the most talented forces around.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSuorjIspihq12nvK2xjKKlZqyYmnqurdOroLFlopq5sK3Dnptmr5GoerOxwpqqrWWRm8GmvoyhnKtlpKeuqLXCZpyaqpyueqWxwK2fZ6Ckorlw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./abdullah-ii-king-of-jordan-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Abdullah II King Of Jordan Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-do-bed-bug-stains-look-like-on-sheets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What do bed bug stains look like on sheets?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
