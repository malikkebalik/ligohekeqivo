Despite being blind (at just six weeks of age, she was blinded by improper treatment of an eye infection), Fanny composed around 8,000 hymns during her lifetime. Of her blindness, Fanny said:</p><p>“It seemed intended by the blessed providence of God that I should be blind all my life, and I thank him for the dispensation. If perfect earthly sight were offered me tomorrow I would not accept it. I might not have sung hymns to the praise of God if I had been distracted by the beautiful and interesting things about me.”1</p><p>Fanny began writing verses at the age of eight. By age 15, she entered the New York City School for the Blind where she began to develop her talent. She started by writing words for secular songs, and she earned significant royalties (particularly for her popular song Rosalie, The Prairie Flower). After graduating, Fanny stayed at the School for the Blind as a teacher; for over 10 years, she taught English grammar, rhetoric, and Roman and American history.2 In 1859, Fanny married Alexander Van Alstyne, a blind musician who also taught at the School for the Blind.3</p><p>Fanny was in her 40s when she was asked by composer William Bradbury to write her first hymn. It was a success, and Fanny realized that hymn writing was God’s call on her life. Hymnologist Charles Johnson records:</p><p>“As the years went by [Fanny’s] name became a magic formula for success to music composers and publishers. At one point, she was under contract to produce three hymns per week and while so doing, she still provided hymns for her composer friends, Bradbury, Root, Doane, Lowry, Sankey, and others.”4</p><p>In addition to hymn writing, Fanny was active as a devotional speaker and counselor until she was over 90 years old.5 Fanny’s gifts attracted the attention of many prominent people, including U.S. presidents. On her 85th birthday, she received a letter from President Grover Cleveland who wrote:</p><p>“My dear friend: It is more than fifty years ago that our acquaintance and friendship began; and ever since that time I have watched your continuous and interested labor in uplifting humanity, and pointing out the way to an appreciation of God’s goodness and mercy. . . . As one proud to call you an old friend, I desire to be early in congratulating you on your long life of usefulness, and wishing you in the years yet to be added to you, the peace and comfort born of the love of God. Yours very sincerely, Grover Cleveland.”6</p><p>Fanny spent her last few years of life at her daughter’s home in Connecticut before dying at the age of 95. Her tombstone carries the words of one of her famous hymns, “Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine. Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine.”</p><p><strong>Music “Near the Cross” by </strong><strong>William Howard Doane </strong><strong>(1832-1915)</strong></p><img title="William Howard Doane" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebratingholidays.com/Pictures/hymns/doane.jpg alt="William Howard Doane" width=200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><span><strong>William Howard Doane (1832-1915)</strong></span><p>William Doane’s primary work was secular. He ran a very successful woodworking machinery plant in Ciccinnati and was a respected civic leader in the city. He also served more than 25 years as the head of the Mount Auburn Baptist Church Sunday school program.</p><p>Though William viewed music as a hobby, he produced over 2200 hymn tunes in his lifetime and edited more than 40 song books. He worked closely with Moody and Sankey in their popular evangelistic outreaches, and he was Fanny Crosby’s principal collaborator in writing gospel songs.7 Often, William would compose a tune and ask Fanny to come up with words. This was the case with “Jesus, Keep Me Near the Cross.”</p><p>At his death, William left a fortune in a trust which has been used in many philanthropic causes, including the Doane Memorial Music Building at Moody Bible Institute.8</p><h3><strong>Lyrics for “Jesus, Keep Me Near the Cross”:</strong></h3><p>Jesus, keep me near the cross,<br>There a precious fountain<br>Free to all, a healing stream<br>Flows from Calvary’s mountain.</p><p>Refrain</p><p>In the cross, in the cross,<br>Be my glory ever;<br>Till my raptured soul shall find<br>Rest beyond the river.</p><p>Near the cross, a trembling soul,<br>Love and mercy found me;<br>There the bright and morning star<br>Sheds its beams around me.</p><p>Refrain</p><p>Near the cross!
