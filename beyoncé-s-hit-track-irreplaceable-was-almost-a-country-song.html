There were no drums to it and sounded like country-western music,” Ne-Yo told <a href=#><strong>BlackFilm</strong></a> in 2007.</p><p id=par-7_28>After hearing drum beats with the lyrics, Ne-Yo considered making an R&B country-western song instead and ran the track by Beyoncé, who instantly fell in love with it.</p><p id=par-8_9>And as the saying goes, the rest is history.</p><h2>‘Irreplaceable’ became an instant hit</h2><p id=par-9_34>After working in the studio with Ne-Yo to create a song people of either gender could relate to, Beyoncé recorded “Irreplaceable,” and it was released on her second solo studio album, B’Day, in 2006.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_29>The track went on to become Beyoncé’s fourth number-one single in the U.S. and remained at the top of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart for 10 consecutive weeks.</p><p id=par-11_35>Impressively, “Irreplaceable” gained such prominence that Rolling Stone placed it on their lists of Best Songs of the 2000s. It was also named the twenty-fifth most successful song of the 2000s (decade) in the U.S.</p><h2>The song caused major controversy in 2011</h2><p id=par-12_12>Four years after “Irreplaceable” was released, controversy arose surrounding its songwriting credits.</p><p id=par-13_36>During a 2011 interview, Ne-Yo said that he’d wished he kept the song for himself rather than passing it over to Beyoncé, who’d allegedly claimed during one of her shows that she had written the track.</p><p id=par-14_62>“One song that I gave away and didn’t want to, but it’s actually a good thing that I did, is Beyoncé’s ‘Irreplaceable.’ I honestly wrote that song for myself, but that song taught me a very interesting lesson: Many women don’t think that differently. … However, a man singing it comes across a little bit misogynistic, a little bit mean,” Ne-Yo <a href=#>said</a>.</p><p id=par-15_21>After his comment surfaced, Beyoncé fans were offended by the singer’s words, seemingly convinced that he low-key dissed their Queen B.</p><p id=par-16_15>Following some intense backlash on social media, Ne-Yo took to Twitter to defend his remarks.</p><p id=par-17_42>“Aiight my dude. Send me the link to where I said ANYTHING disrespectful about Beyoncé, PLEASE! Dying to hear this,” he wrote. “Just heard the audio where I supposedly dissed Beyoncé. ARE Y’ALL SERIOUS!?! Did y’all even listen to what I said!?!</p><p id=par-18_67>Ne-Yo continued, “I said I originally wrote the song for me. That’s true, so OF COURSE I didn’t want to give it away originally. IT WAS FOR ME. Once I realized how the song comes across if sung by a guy, that’s when I decided to give it away. HOW IS THAT DISSING BEYONCE!?! She took the song and made it a smash, NOBODY can deny that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvpsXOp5qeq12dtrV506uYnKNdnr%2Bzsc%2BlmJydkZe5pnnWmqpmmZyivLTAjJpknKelo8GzxYyspqefXp3BrriO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-chan-s-arrest-on-an-incest-charge-revitalized-a-genre-of-youtube-videos-chronicling-the-sonic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Chan's arrest on an incest charge revitalized a genre of YouTube videos chronicling the 'Sonic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./adrian-zmed-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Adrian Zmed Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
