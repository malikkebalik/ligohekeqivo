as of 2023, he is 80 years old.</p><p>The late Lorenzo Díaz has had a successful career and received many awards.</p><p>He won two Ondas, three Golden Antennas, the National Gastronomy Award, the Madrid Chamber of Commerce Award, and the Best Book on Communication Award.</p><p>Besides his love for radio, he was also passionate about food, evident in his relationships with Concha and former Minister of Labour Magdalena Valerio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lorenzo-Diaz-Padre-1.png><p>As per reports, some of his well-known books include ‘The Radio in Spain (1923–1993)’, ‘Television in Spain 1949–1995’, ‘The Dirty Box: Telebasura in Spain’, and ‘Don Quixote’s Kitchen.’</p><p>Additionally, he wrote biographies of notable people like Luis del Olmo and renowned chefs Lucio Blázquez (from Casa Lucio in Madrid) and Cándido López (from Mesón Cándido in Segovia).</p><p>Further details about Lorenzo Díaz Padre on Wikipedia, including his educational background, were not readily available when publishing this article.</p><h2>Lorenzo Díaz Padre spouse</h2><p>The passing of Lorenzo Díaz comes 10 years to the day after the death of his former partner, acclaimed journalist Concha García Campoy.</p><p>Díaz and García Campoy shared a romantic relationship from 1992 to 2000, during which time he greatly admired her reporting talents and saw her as an innovative force within the industry.</p><p>As per sources, García, a former partner of Diaz, died in Valencia on July 10, 2013, at age 54, succumbing to health complications related to her battle with leukemia, which had prompted her to step back from her television career a year and a half prior.</p><p>She initially underwent a bone marrow transplant that appeared successful but later required an umbilical cord transplant as well as further treatment before ultimately passing away.</p><p>Despite no longer being romantically involved in her final decade of life, Díaz maintained high praise for García Campoy’s skills and contributions as a newswoman both during and after their partnership.</p><p>The aligned date of their deaths, exactly 10 years apart, is a striking coincidence.</p><h2>Lorenzo Díaz Padre family</h2><p>In his personal life, Díaz was involved with Magdalena Valerio, the current president of the Spanish Council of State and former government minister.</p><p>He was also formerly in a long-term relationship with the late journalist Concha García Campoy, with whom he had two children: a son named Lorenzo (born in 1993) and a daughter named Berta (born in 1998).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lorenzo-Diaz-Padre-2.png><p>Both children pursued careers in journalism and broadcasting, following in their parents’ professional footsteps.</p><p>Additionally, Díaz had an older daughter named Eva from a previous relationship. While little is known about Díaz’s extended familial background, some reports indicate he may have had at least one grandchild via his eldest daughter Eva’s marriage.</p><p>However, the details surrounding his surviving family members and his two younger children remain scarce.</p><p><strong>Also Read</strong>: <a href=# rel=noopener>Tori Roloff Parents: Kim And Gary Patton Ethnicity And Age</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZa5tbTYqZyeqKNjsLC5jqWmq52er7xusMiasWaokZm%2FpnnWoqKiqJWZtqJ5xJ2YnWWjpby2v8RmmKecXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-tiktok-s-proof-not-everything-can-be-an-album-cover-trend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is TikToks proof not everything can be an album cover trend?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cruise-to-puerto-princesa-philippines.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cruise to Puerto Princesa, Philippines</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
