However, as the seasons progressed, Kody’s attitude shifted as he spent more time with Robyn Brown and less with Meri, Janelle, and Christine Brown. As season 18 ended, Kody Brown called himself “the devil I think I am now,” and viewers can thank Robyn for creating a monster.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robyn-brown-created-a-monster-in-kody-brown>Robyn Brown created a monster in Kody Brown</h2><p id=par-2_26>The fourth of Kody Brown’s wives helped shape him into the monster he is today. His once happy personality switched to that of an <a href=#>angry victim</a>.</p><p id=par-3_45>From the beginning, Robyn came into the Brown family behaving like a victim. She once wrote on Twitter, per<a href=#> E! News</a>. “I ended my first marriage because of abuse. My kids come first ALWAYS.” Her ex-husband, David Jessop, neither confirmed nor clarified her damaging allegations.</p><p id=par-4_22>Kody adopted Robyn’s victim mentality. He was a willing pupil, learning her passive-aggressive method of communication to the <a href=#>determent of his family</a>.</p><p id=par-5_31>Kody soon began blaming everyone for almost everything that’s gone wrong within their polygamist clan over the past several years. It was Christine, Meri, and Janelle’s fault their marriages ended.</p><p id=par-6_32>It was his kids’ fault that he couldn’t see them because they wouldn’t abide by his coronavirus (COVID-19) rules. And it was their fault his relationships with their mothers didn’t work out.</p><p id=par-7_12>In turn, Kody was a victim. Robyn played the same game expertly.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robyn-brown-taught-kody-their-relationship-comes-first>Robyn Brown taught Kody their relationship comes first</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_28>Sister Wives viewers watched as Robyn Brown taught Kody their relationship comes first. Even though Kody had 13 children with three other wives before Robyn entered their family.</p><p id=par-9_37>She insisted he forge close relationships with her children, whom she taught to obey Kody’s rules and regulations. Robyn told them to treat him as the family patriarch, whether or not they agreed or disagreed with him.</p><p id=par-10_41>Therefore, knowing he was king of Robyn’s castle, Kody expected his other wives to “be compliant to our family structure” like Robyn. However, as Kody and Robyn became a closer couple, Meri, Janelle, and Christine Brown got a taste of freedom.</p><p id=par-11_52>Subsequently, the monster came out, and Kody became angry at the women for not acting more like Robyn, whom he called “fundamentally loyal.” However, it appeared to viewers that Kody didn’t care what his other wives did when he wasn’t around. He would flip a switch and cause <a href=#>strategic chaos</a> between them.</p><p id=par-12_46>At best, Kody broke polygamy’s unwritten rule by giving all his love and attention to one wife. As he continued to put her above his other wives, a clear power imbalance occurred in the Brown family. Robyn controlled Kody’s head to move any way she wished.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-monster-turned-into-a-laughingstock>Her monster turned into a laughingstock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/meri-robyn-kody-christine-janelle-brown-of-Sister-Wives.jpg><p id=par-13_29>Sister Wives was created with the sole intent of normalizing polygamy to the masses. The family was part of the Mormon fundamentalist group called the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB).</p><p id=par-14_52>This religious belief system is based on one man’s number of wives and proximity to the Celestial Kingdom. Reportedly, the more wives a man has, the more he will be the head of his own kingdom, where he will be eternally tied to these women and their offspring in a Celestial Kingdom.</p><p id=par-15_37>Kody became a laughingstock in the church and on television, because he didn’t have the capacity to maintain all his relationships properly. This was heightened when the family would visit polygamist friends who were in functioning marriages.</p><p id=par-16_34>He pointed the finger at everyone except Robyn, regarding why the family began to unravel. The monster turned into a screaming toddler in a multitude of on-camera blowups when he didn’t get his way.</p><p id=par-17_32>Kody’s behavior rippled through his now broken family. The new season could allow Kody to rehabilitate himself, but that likely won’t happen. Villainous Kody makes more <a href=#>money for TLC</a> than nice Kody.</p><p id=par-18_11>Sister Wives Season 19 will air sometime in late summer 2024.</p><p id=par-19_20><strong>How to get help:</strong> In the U.S., call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 or text START to 88788.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAqr%2FTnqlmr5mrsrR50aiZsqZdl7%2Bww81mmqudkamypXnMqKWsrJWneqy7w7Jkm6qfrLtvtNOmo2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./was-nicole-kidman-actually-born-in-the-united-states.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Was Nicole Kidman Actually Born in the United States?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./halle-berry-s-son-maceo-robert-martinez-wiki-bio-age-parents-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Halle Berrys son Maceo Robert Martinez Wiki Bio, Age, Parents, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
