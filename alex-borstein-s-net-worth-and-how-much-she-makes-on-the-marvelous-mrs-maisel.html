The subject of money often comes up on the show; specifically, how much of it Midge has and how little Susie does. But fictional wealth aside, Borstein is doing fairly well for herself in Hollywood. Here’s her net worth and how much she makes on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Borstein got her start on MADtv<br></h2><p id=par-2_53>After leaving Chicago for the Los Angeles area has a child, Borstein grew up ready to be a comedian. She was brought on as a writer and cast member for <a href=#>Season 3 of MADtv</a>. Borstein was on the show for five seasons, leaving in 2002, but she made her mark on the series.<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She voices a popular TV character<br></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-3_105>Even if you don’t recognize her face, you probably know her voice. <a href=#>Borstein has voiced the role of Lois Griffin on the long-running comedy Family Guy</a> since the very beginning of the animated series. She also voices other characters on occasion and considers creator Seth MacFarlane to be a good friend. Borstein has appeared in other MacFarlane productions over the years, including the short-lived series Bordertown and the films Ted and A Million Ways to Die in the West. She starred on the HBO series Getting On, a remake of the British series of the same name, from 2013 until its cancelation in 2015.<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Borstein was on Gilmore Girls<br></h2><p id=par-4_79>Before joining up with <a href=#>Amy Sherman-Palladino for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</a>, Borstein worked with the writer and creator on Gilmore Girls. In fact, Borstein was initially cast in the role of chef Sookie St. James, which then went to Melissa McCarthy when Borstein’s MADtv contract prevented her from taking it. Borstein did appear on Gilmore&nbsp;Girls in numerous guest spots, while her then-husband, Jackson Douglas, played Sookie’s series-long love interest. (The couple was married from 1999-2014, and have two children.)<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How much does Alex Borstein make for The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel?<br></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-5_69>In her divorce settlement, it was reported that Borstein makes <a href=#>$222,000/month for Family Guy</a>. According to Celebrity Net Worth, her yearly total salary is $5 million. If that is all correct, that leaves approximately 2.4 million unaccounted for, which could indicate her <a href=#>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel salary</a> is somewhere between 2 and 3 million per season. And she could be making even more than that for Season 3.<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Borstein’s net worth<br></h2><p id=par-6_40><a href=#>Borstein’s total net worth</a> is estimated to be around $24 million. However, this number may have been calculated prior to her divorce, during which the couple’s earnings were split 50-50. So she may not be worth that much these days.<br></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Like her character, Borstein is Jewish<br></h2><p id=par-7_73>Susie Myerson’s religion isn’t touched upon too often, but all of the <a href=#>main characters on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel are Jewish</a>. Speaking to Jewish Journal, Borstein described her background, noting that her mother is a Holocaust survivor, as was her grandmother. She credits them with helping her in her role as Susie, calling her grandmother “very funny, very dark, very b***hy,” and noted her mom’s advanced degrees, calling them both “tough broads.”</p><p id=par-8_1><a href=#>Check&nbsp;out&nbsp;the&nbsp;Cheat&nbsp;Sheet&nbsp;on&nbsp;Facebook!</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSurbHXZpmoqqOpsqq6jKecrWWnpL%2B1tI2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-watch-voltes-v-legacy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to watch Voltes V: Legacy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./al-roker-shares-how-his-eating-habits-have-changed-since-health-scare-everything-in-moderation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title></p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
