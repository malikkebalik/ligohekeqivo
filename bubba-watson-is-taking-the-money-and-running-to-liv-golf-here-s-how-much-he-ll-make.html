The Saudi-backed league has poached several golfers away from the PGA Tour, including <a href=# rel=noopener>Phil Mickelson</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Dustin Johnson</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Sergio Garcia</a>. It's done so by offering exorbitant amounts of money and a less grueling schedule.</p><p>Let's add <a href=# rel=noopener>Bubba Watson</a> to the growing list of golfers joining the LIV ranks.</p><p>Watson will reportedly earn $50 million to join the LIV Tour. He's already slated to play in events this year in New Jersey and Boston, and will captain one of 12 teams in next year's LIV Golf League. In that league, captains will lead "franchises" that can build up their fanbases and partner with sponsors.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-335824 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1398699529.jpg alt width=900 height=646 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-335824 class=wp-caption-text>David Cannon/Getty Images</p><p>Watson won the Masters in 2012 and 2014 but hasn't seen as much success over the past few years. He missed the last two majors and is just 86th in the World Rankings as of this writing. Those struggles likely played a role in his decision to join LIV. Unlike the PGA Tour, LIV events pay every single player that participates, not just those who make the cut. In Watson's first event, the last-place finisher will still earn around $120,000. LIV events also only play 54 instead of 72 holes.</p><p>LIV is controversial because it's backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, whose government has been behind several human rights violations, including the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The league has plenty of money to throw around, though, and it's led to <a href=# rel=noopener>several players leaving the rigors of the PGA Tour</a> in exchange for the more laid-back, luxurious feel of LIV Golf. <a href=# rel=noopener>Johnson took a $125 million deal</a> to join the league, while <a href=# rel=noopener>Mickelson agreed to a $200 million contract</a>.</p><p>The PGA Tour has warned players they would not be welcome at tour events if they participated in LIV events. While most players haven't publicly said why they're joining LIV — though in many cases, it's likely the huge amounts of money they're earning — Mickelson said he hoped players joining LIV would "do a lot of good for the game" of golf. However, critics have accused players of "sportswashing" for the Saudi government.</p><p>Watson likely won't be the last player to jump from the PGA Tour to LIV Golf. And even if he continues struggling on the golf course, he'll end up taking home quite a bit of money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjpusm5qRYsSiwNKopWaho2LBorfIp55mrJiaeq67zZ6wZpmemXqzwc2noKefXam8brjIr2Sgp5ybeqmx0Z6qZqCfrHquwcKhZKGdnKF6rq3KnmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elon-musk-s-family-is-messy-his-father-had-a-baby-with-his-adult-stepdaughter.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elon Musks family is messy, his father had a baby with his adult stepdaughter</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./benedict-cumberbatch-net-worth-cars-charity.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Benedict Cumberbatch Net Worth : Cars &amp;amp; Charity</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
