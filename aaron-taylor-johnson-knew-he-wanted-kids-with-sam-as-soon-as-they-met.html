This will be your first chance to see Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, officially joining the Marvel universe (except Quicksilver was in X-Men: Days of Future Past but it was a different actor). Oh… wait, Aaron did an uncredited cameo in Captain America: Winter Soldier, so nevermind. You probably already know him then.</p><p>I don’t have much of an opinion of Aaron as an actor. The only thing I’ve really seen him in was Kick-Ass. He made it work in that film, but I would imagine joining the Marvel universe will do good things for his career. In any case, Aaron has a new interview with Marie Claire UK. He talks about his wife, Sam Taylor Johnson, who is 48 (Aaron is 24), and their marriage and how proud he is of her work on Fifty Shades of Grey. Some highlights:</p><p><strong>Whether he considered playing Christian Grey: </strong>“No, never! I think there would have been a lot of unhappy fans of the book. We both read it and knew right then that when she went into direct it, I wouldn’t be the one to step into those shoes. And that was fine. It didn’t feel like one of us was like, ‘I really wanted to do that’. I’m obviously really, really proud of Sam and it was great to see her take that project and make it her own, and not have to feel like just because there’s a role… I feel like I’m too young for that role anyway!”</p><p><strong>On his marriage:</strong> “With Sam I just knew. I just knew I wanted kids with her, I wanted to be with her and I wanted to get married to her. I never had that moment like, ‘I want to be an actor’, but I love being a dad.”</p><p><a href=#>[From MTV UK]</a></p><p>Too young for Christian Grey and yet old enough to be married to the 48-year-old director and have two kids with her? Sure. As Aaron and Sam’s marriage lasts longer than I was originally expecting, I have to say that they are growing on me. A little bit. I still think there’s something “off” about their relationship and that they probably won’t last forever, but you know what? You could say about most couples. Imagine Aaron at the age of 18, meeting his 42-year-old director and thinking, “This woman will be the mother of my children.” That’s intense. He was either a very intense 18-year-old or he’s taking some creative liberties with their romantic history. God knows.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wenn22223156.jpg alt=wenn22223156 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbWpgZ4B0e8Caqaimj6muurjOq2Sjp5ijwLC6vqSlnq%2BPnbKgw8Cnq56cj6C2pb%2B%2BsKCtoI%2Borq6rwKyWrKefo6yiv76tn56xj6KytXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bitchy-jessica-simpson-at-the-37th-annual-footwear-news-achievement-awards.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>bitchy | Jessica Simpson at the 37th Annual Footwear News Achievement Awards</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-clifton-davis-dating-clifton-davis-s-wife-exes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Clifton Davis Dating Clifton Davis's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
