During his time with the show, Harrison diversified his role and became, not only the host of the original show and its spin-offs, but a producer as well. He also reportedly received quite a nice payout from ABC. So, what is his net worth now?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chris-Harrison-1.jpg><h2 id=h-chris-harrison-s-salary-and-net-worth>Chris Harrison’s salary and net worth</h2><p id=par-2_80>Harrison may be the face of The Bachelor, but the former host was working in entertainment and stacking his wealth before he appeared on the dating show. He started his career as a sports reporter for CBS affiliate KWTV from 1993-1999. He also hosted a show called Designers’ Challenge on HGTV in 1999. In 2001, he hosted the game show Mall Masters on the Game Show Network. Then, he 2002, he landed the job as the host of The Bachelor.</p><p id=par-3_57>Since then, Harrison has hosted 25 seasons of The Bachelor. The Bachelorette began in 2003 and Harrison also hosted that show until 2021. From 2010-2012, Harrison also hosted the short-lived Bachelor Pad. His other spin-offs include 2018’s Bachelor Winter Games, and 2020’s The Bachelor Presents: Listen to Your Heart. He also hosted Bachelor in Paradise from 2014-2021.</p><p id=par-4_28>In addition to The Bachelor, Harrison has appeared on TV shows like Sabrina the Teenage Witch and even released a book called The Perfect Letter: A Novel.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_19>Harrison’s Bachelor salary was $8 million and his current net worth, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, is $25 million.</p><h2 id=h-did-his-exit-affect-his-net-worth>Did his exit affect his net worth?</h2><p id=par-6_32>Harrison made the bulk of his money working in the Bachelor franchise. Earlier this year, the host took a break from the franchise after defending contestant Rachael Kirkconnell’s past racist actions.</p><p id=par-7_59>“This historic season of ‘The Bachelor’ should not be marred or overshadowed by my mistakes or diminished by my actions,” he said in an&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;post, announcing his hiatus. “To that end, I have consulted with Warner Bros. and ABC and will be stepping aside for a period of time and will not join for the After the Final Rose special.”</p><p id=par-8_31>Though Harrison promised he’d be back, his hiatus stretched through The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise. Yesterday, it was announced that Harrison actually was not returning to the franchise at all.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-9_55>“I’ve had a truly incredible run as host of&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;franchise and now I’m excited to start a new chapter,” Harrison said of his exit on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. “I’m so grateful to Bachelor Nation for all of the memories we’ve made together. While my two-decade journey is wrapping up, the friendships I’ve made will last a lifetime.”</p><p id=par-10_62>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>, Harrison did not leave the franchise empty handed. Before he left, the tv star reportedly received an eight-figure payout, which definitely didn’t hurt his net worth one bit. Details about the exact amount have not been released, but given the secrecy of The Bachelor franchise as a whole, we may never find out just how much Harrison took home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMm5icoJWhvLN5wqGpoqtdna6zvsispqerXaOytXnWqKmtoF2hsqLCyKeeZquYpMRvtNOmo2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./young-dolph-net-worth-lifestyle-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Young Dolph Net Worth: Lifestyle &amp;amp; Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./robin-harris-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Robin Harris Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./are-kevin-costner-and-christine-baumgartner-still-together-updates-on-their-relationship.html>Are Kevin Costner and Christine Baumgartner Still Together?
