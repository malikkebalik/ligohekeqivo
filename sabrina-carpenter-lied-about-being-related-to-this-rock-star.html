But there was a time when Carpenter had to embellish her music credentials, claiming that she was related to <a href=#>a certain classic rock star</a>. She said the classic rock star made a song that meant a lot to her parents. Notably, the tune in question was originally designed to be a jingle for a bank.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sabrina-carpenter-loves-the-hopeful-lyrics-of-this-classic-rock-song>Sabrina Carpenter loves the hopeful lyrics of this classic rock song</h2><p id=par-2_65>During a 2018 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Teen Vogue</a>, the former Disney star said she was a huge fan of The Carpenters’ “We’ve Only Just Begun.” “I always wanted to tell people that we were related because I had no other answer for where I got my voice from or started singing from, so I would always say, you know, The Carpenters,” <a href=#>the “Nonsense” singer</a> said.</p><p id=par-3_38>“Karen Carpenter’s voice was always just something that had a huge impact on my life, and this isn’t the only song by them that I love, but it’s a special song to me because it’s my parents’ song.”</p><p id=par-4_61><a href=#>The “Espresso” singer</a> revealed another reason why “We’ve Only Just Begun” speaks to her. “It’s just the melody, it’s so, it’s so melancholy at the same time as it’s so beautiful and hopeful because it’s saying we’ve only just begun,” she said. Part of what makes the track so great is that it includes some of The Carpenters’ most emotional lyrics.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-we-ve-only-just-begun-went-from-a-commercial-jingle-to-a-classic-rock-song>How ‘We’ve Only Just Begun’ went from a commercial jingle to a classic rock song</h2><p id=par-5_90>Today, “We’ve Only Just Begun” is often seen as a work of art. That’s fascinating because it started out as something that wasn’t very artistic: a commercial. The tune was co-written by Paul Williams, the writer behind hits such as Barbra Streisand’s “Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)” and Three Dog Night’s “Just an Old Fashioned Love Song.” During a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Songwriter</a>, Williams he said that the song started as a commercial jingle for Crocker Bank. Williams didn’t see the tune’s origins as very romantic.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_55>“We’ve Only Just Begun” was supposed to narrate the lives of a young couple. Williams didn’t imagine anyone would want to record it, but The Carpenters released their version of it as a single. It remains one of their most beloved songs. The Carpenters knew how to turn sentimentality into art like few other bands.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sabrina-carpenter-s-taste-extends-beyond-classic-rock>Sabrina Carpenter’s taste extends beyond classic rock</h2><p id=par-7_52>During her Teen Vogue interview, Carpenter put The Carpenters’ “We’ve Only Just Begun” on a playlist of the tracks that defined her life. Other tunes on the playlist included Christina Auilera’s “Beautiful,” <a href=#>The Beatles’ “Rocky Raccoon,”</a> Skeeter Davis’ “The End of the World,” and ABBA’s “Dancing Queen.” Her tastes are certainly eclectic!</p><p id=par-8_38>“This is the playlist of my life,” she said. “All these songs kinda represent a different period in my life in the past, my life in the present, probably in the future. Hope you guys like my playlist.</p><p id=par-9_27>“Hope you listen to it,” she said. “And I hope you like it. I said that already, I said that twice. Cool, I’m gonna go home now.”</p><p id=par-10_14>You should listen to The Carpenter’s “We’ve Only Just Begun.” You’ll probably like it!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAoq7RoqWaZZOWv7Gxza2cq2WcnrKledGeo5qslZl6s7vCpGSsrJGne6nAzKVm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wizkid-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wizkid Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-money-does-bizzy-bone-make-latest-income-salary.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Money Does Bizzy Bone Make?
